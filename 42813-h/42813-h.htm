<h2><a name="CHAPTER_I" id="CHAPTER_I">CHAPTER I</a></h2>


<p class="cap"><span class="upper">The</span> room looked very cool in the afternoon
light. A few bowls of white roses that were
arranged about it seemed to lend it an aspect
of more than usual specklessness.</p>

<p>To Madame Querterot, a person of no taste, who
made no pretension of being fastidious, and who had,
moreover, little sympathy with a passion for cleanliness
when this was carried to exaggeration, the airy lightness
of the place suggested the convent school of her
youthful days; and, bringing again before her the
figure of a stern sister superior who had been accustomed
in those vanished times to deal out severe
penalties to the youthful but constantly erring Justine,
caused her invariably to enter Mrs. Vanderstein&rsquo;s
bedroom after a quick intake of the breath on the
threshold, as if she were about to plunge into an icy
bath.</p>

<p>Mrs. Vanderstein, ever the essence of punctuality,
was ready for her on this particular evening, as she
always was.</p>

<p>Wrapped in some diaphanous white garment, which
she would perhaps have called a dressing-gown, she lay
on a silk covered sofa and lazily watched Madame
Querterot unpacking the little bag in which she carried
the accessories of her profession, that of a hairdresser
and beauty specialist.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;You must make me very beautiful to-night,
Madame Justine,&rdquo; she said, with a smile. &ldquo;We are
going to hear <i>La Boh√®me</i>, and the Queen will be there.
My box is nearly opposite the Royal box, and in case
Her Majesty&rsquo;s eyes fall in my direction I wish to look
my best.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All eyes will not fail to be directed to your side of
the theatre, madame,&rdquo; replied Madame Querterot,
taking out her collection of pomade pots, powder
boxes and washes, and arranging them in a semicircle
upon a Louis XVI table. &ldquo;Royalties know the use
of opera glasses as well as any citizen. As for making
you beautiful, the good God has occupied Himself with
that! I can only preserve what I find. I can make
your beauty endure, madame. More than that one
must not ask of me. I am not the good God, me!&rdquo;
and Madame Querterot&rsquo;s plump shoulders shook with
easy merriment.</p>

<p>Mrs. Vanderstein, too, smiled. She did not suffer
from any affectation of modesty as far as her obvious
good looks were concerned. But she was obliged to
own regretfully&mdash;though only to herself&mdash;that she was
no longer as young as she had been; and the masseuse&rsquo;s
assurances that her youthful appearance could
be indefinitely preserved fell on her ears as melodiously
as if they were indeed a prelude to the magic strains
that would presently rise to charm her through the
envied, if stuffy atmosphere of Covent Garden.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are a flatterer, Madame Justine,&rdquo; she murmured.
Then, before she laid her head back against
the cushions and gave herself up to Madame Querterot&rsquo;s
ministrations, she called to a figure that was
seated in the window, half hidden among the muslin
curtains that fluttered before it: &ldquo;Barbara, be sure and
tell me if you see anything interesting.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Barbara Turner answered without looking round:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothing has come yet, but I am keeping a good
look-out.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Vanderstein closed her eyes, and Madame
Querterot, after turning up her sleeves and arraying
herself in an apron, began to pass her short fingers over
the placid features and smooth skin of the lady&rsquo;s face.
For a time nothing else stirred in the big room.</p>

<p>A ray of sunlight passed very slowly across a portion
of the grey panelled walls, and coming to a gilded
mirror climbed cautiously over the carved frame, only
to be caught and held a while on the flashing surface
of the looking-glass.</p>

<p>On every side the subdued gold of ancient frames,
surrounding priceless pictures that had been acquired
by the help of the excellent judgment and long
purse of the late Mr. Vanderstein, shone softly and
pleasantly.</p>

<p>The furniture, of the best period of the reign of
Louis XVI&mdash;as was the case all over the house&mdash;had
been collected by the same unerring connoisseur, and
each piece would have been welcomed with tears of joy
by many an eager director of museums.</p>

<p>The thick carpet that covered the floor exactly
matched the pale grey tone of the walls and upholstery,
and the extreme lightness of these imparted that air of
great luxury which the lavish use of fragile colours, in
a town as dirty as London, does more to convey than
any more ostentatious sign of extravagance.</p>

<p>Through the open casements many noises rose from
the street, for the bedroom was at the front of the
house, which stood in a street in Mayfair immediately
opposite to a great hotel where the overflow of foreign
Royalty is frequently sheltered at times of Court
festivals, when the hospitable walls of the Palace are
filled to bursting point.</p>

<p>The coming and going of these distinguished guests<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
was always a source of the most unquenchable interest
to Mrs. Vanderstein, to whom every trivial action,
if it were performed by any sort of a Highness, was
brimming with thrilling suggestion.</p>

<p>At the period of which I speak, London was astir
with preparations for a great function, and representatives
of the Courts of Europe were arriving by every
train from the Continent.</p>

<p>Mrs. Vanderstein could hear the sounds of a constant
stream of carriages and motors stopping or starting
below her window, and knew that it was not to her
door that they crowded, but across the road under the
magnificent stucco portico of Fianti&rsquo;s Hotel.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Barbara, has no one interesting appeared?&rdquo; she
called again after a few minutes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not yet,&rdquo; was the reply. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a victoria
driving along the street now, though, which looks
something like a Royal turnout. Rather a nice
looking pair in it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is it a pair of foreign looking gentlemen?&rdquo; asked
Mrs. Vanderstein excitedly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, a pair of Cleveland bays. I hate them as a
rule, but from here they don&rsquo;t look bad. All back,
though, of course.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My dear girl, do tell me about the people. I don&rsquo;t
want to hear about your horrid horses. I believe all
sorts of celebrities go in and out of Fianti&rsquo;s while I am
lying here, and you never even notice them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes, I do,&rdquo; said Barbara. &ldquo;I will call you
directly any one passes who looks as if he might be
accustomed to wield the sceptre, or who is wearing a
crown over his top hat.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Vanderstein made a little impatient movement.
It annoyed her that her companion did not take her
duties more seriously&mdash;did not, in fact, seem to understand
how much more important was this task of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
keeping a good look-out in the wide bow of the window
than any of the others that she was apt to approach in
a quite admirable spirit of thoroughness. Why,
wondered Mrs. Vanderstein, could the girl not do as
she was asked in this matter, without making those
attempts to be facetious which appeared so ill-advised,
and which fell so extremely flat, as a moment&rsquo;s observation
would have made apparent to her? She did
not make jokes about the flowers while she arranged
them, nor about Mrs. Vanderstein&rsquo;s correspondence, to
which it was her business to attend. She was able to
answer the telephone or order the carriage without
indulging in unseemly giggles. Why then, in heaven&rsquo;s
name, couldn&rsquo;t she take up her post of observation at
the window without finding in it an excuse for
pleasantries as dull as they were pointless?</p>

<p>Mrs. Vanderstein sighed deeply and wriggled her
head deeper in the cushions.</p>

<p>Madame Querterot saw the cloud and guessed very
easily what had caused it: she had often noticed similar
disturbances of her customer&rsquo;s otherwise easy-going
temper. Knowing with remarkable accuracy on which
side of her bread the butter was applied, she at once set
herself to calm the troubled waters.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You did not see me to-day, madame,&rdquo; she began,
&ldquo;but me, I have already seen you. I passed in Piccadilly
where your auto was stopped in a block before
the Ritz.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, we were kept there quite a long time, but I did
not see you, Madame Justine,&rdquo; said Mrs. Vanderstein
indifferently.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How should you have seen me? I was in a bus.
It&rsquo;s not there that you would look for your acquaintances.
That understands itself! But I was not the
only one to see you, and what I heard said of you then
will make you smile. I said to myself at the moment,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
&lsquo;It is quite natural, Justine, but it will make her
laugh all the same.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What was it? Who can have said anything of me
in an omnibus?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, madame! Even in buses people do not cease
to talk. One hears things to make one twist with
laughter! But one hears the truth too, sometimes, and
this young man, even if he made a mistake, one cannot
surprise oneself at that!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But you do not tell me what you heard,&rdquo; cried Mrs.
Vanderstein.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was this young man of whom I speak to you.
He was a nice smart looking young gentleman, and he
had with him a lady, well dressed and very chic. What
they did in that <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">gal√®re</i> I know not, but as we passed the
Ritz he touched his companion on the arm and pointed
out of the window. &lsquo;Look, Alice,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;you see
the dark lady in that motor? It is the Russian
Princess they talk so much about, Princess Sonia. Is
she not handsome? She was pointed out to me last
night at the Foreign Office reception.&rsquo; The lady he
called Alice looked where he pointed and every one in
the bus looked also. I, too, turned round and followed
the eyes of the others. And who did I see, madame?
Can you not guess? It was at you they looked, as you
sat there in your beautiful car with Mademoiselle
Turner beside you. You, with your flowers and your
pretty hat with the long white feather, and your
wonderful pearls. And your face, madame! But I
must not permit myself to speak of that!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You talk great nonsense, and I do not believe a
word you say,&rdquo; said Mrs. Vanderstein gaily, her good-humour
more than restored. &ldquo;No one could mistake
me for a moment for the beautiful Princess Sonia.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nevertheless, madame, it happened as I say. And
I see nothing strange about it. It was a very natural<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
mistake, as anyone who has seen both you and the
Princess will readily agree.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Madame Querterot had not seen the Princess herself,
but she had studied her photograph in the illustrated
papers and devoutly hoped that Mrs. Vanderstein had
not herself met the lady at closer quarters.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The poor young man was not near enough to
observe my wrinkles and my double chin, Madame
Justine!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bah! You will have forgotten the word wrinkle,
which is not <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">d&rsquo;ailleurs</i> a pretty one, by the time I have
finished giving you my course of treatment. And as
for a double chin, look at me, madame! I assure you
that, in my time, I have developed no less than five
double chins. And I have rubbed them all away. Do
you suppose, then, that I shall allow you to have
one?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Vanderstein looked as she was bidden. Indeed
she lost no opportunity of studying the countenance of
the little Frenchwoman, who, on her own admission,
was at least ten years older than herself, but whose face
was as smooth and unlined as that of a girl, though
there was an indefinable something in the expression,
an experienced glimmer, perhaps, in the eyes, that
prevented her appearance from being entirely youthful.</p>

<p>Still, she might very well have been taken for Mrs.
Vanderstein&rsquo;s junior, even for her younger sister,
possibly, if she had been as well dressed, for there was
a certain resemblance between the two women. Both
were short and plump, both had long oval faces and
brown eyes set rather near together beneath arched,
well-marked eyebrows, and, though Madame Querterot
had not a drop of Jewish blood in her veins and
her nose did not assume the Hebraic droop that in
Mrs. Vanderstein betrayed her race, yet it was distinctly
of the hooked variety and gave her a family likeness to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
the children of Israel, on which fact her relations and
friends had frequently considered it entertaining to
dwell. Her hair, however, was golden and fluffy,
curling about her head with a juvenile abandon; while
Mrs. Vanderstein&rsquo;s dark, straight locks were simply
and severely dressed at the back, and concealed on her
forehead by a large, flat curled fringe in the manner
affected by the English Royal ladies.</p>

<p>Mrs. Vanderstein at all events was sincere in her
admirations.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you can make me look as young as you do,&rdquo; she
said now, &ldquo;I ask nothing better. But indeed London
in this hot weather is very wearing, and I see myself
grow older every morning. To-day it was oppressive
to drive even in an open motor.&rdquo;</p>

<p>To drive? Ah! Madame Querterot was not imaginative,
but a vision of the crowded bus in which
she went about her business floated before her, side by
side with one of a rushing motor car; and she paused
in her work for a minute and looked around her.</p>

<p>An electric fan revolved tirelessly above the window,
and on a table at the foot of the bed was placed a large
block of ice, half hidden in flowers and ferns. She
raised herself, inhaling the cool air in long, deep
breaths.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It has been hot, very hot, these last days,&rdquo; she
admitted. &ldquo;It reminds me of our beautiful Paris,
and of much in my young days that I would be content
to forget,&rdquo; she added, with a laugh. &ldquo;Ah, the room
in that city, in which as a girl I used to work; the little
dark room where I learnt my trade! It was hot in that
room in the summer. But, madame, I could not tell
you how hot it was. I remember one of the girls who
used to pray quite seriously to die, because, she
explained to us, wherever she went in another world
it could not fail to be more cool. It was over a baker&rsquo;s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
kitchen and had no window except one which gave on
to a sort of shaft that ran up the middle of the house, so
that we had the gas always burning. Oh, la, la!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How dreadful!&rdquo; murmured Mrs. Vanderstein
comfortably. &ldquo;I wonder it was allowed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Allowed? Ah, madame, there are plenty of worse
workrooms than that in Paris. I wonder what you
would say if you could see your dresses made! We
liked it very well in the winter, for there were no stairs,
and it was agreeable then to shut the window and
profit by the warmth from the kitchen. That was all
long ago, before I married that poor Eug√®ne and came
to live in London. They were, all the same, not so bad,
those days. Ah, la jeunesse, la belle jeunesse, which
one does not know how to enjoy when one has it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Madame Querterot crossed over to the table and laid
her hands on the block of ice, casting a glance over her
shoulder to the window where Barbara sat at her
sentry post. The motionless, silent figure annoyed
Madame Querterot. To be conscious that all her
chatter was overheard by that quiet listener got on her
nerves and sometimes made her, as she said, feel as if
her own words would suffocate her. There was so
much she could have said to Mrs. Vanderstein from
time to time if they had been alone&mdash;much that she
instinctively felt would have been very acceptable to
that lady&mdash;but in the presence of Miss Turner, even
though nothing of her were visible except the back of
her head, there were, it appeared, lengths of flattery to
which Madame Querterot found herself incapable of
proceeding. Thus did a feeling of awkwardness, some
sense of restraint, cast a certain gloom over hours that
should have been the brightest in the day.</p>

<p>&ldquo;These roses, madame, how fine they are,&rdquo; she
murmured, bending towards a bowl that stood on the
table, and unconsciously her voice took on a note of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
defiance as she faced the window. &ldquo;They are as
beautiful as if they were artificial. One would say
they were made of silk!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Vanderstein laughed tolerantly, but Barbara,
her face turned to the street, made a naughty face.</p>

<p>Madame Querterot, with hands ice cool, went back
to her massage, and for a little while again no one
spoke.</p>

<p>Suddenly Barbara turned.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here comes a Royal carriage,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I think
it is Prince Felipe of Targona and his mother.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh I must see them,&rdquo; cried Mrs. Vanderstein,
jumping up, and brushing Madame Querterot unceremoniously
aside. &ldquo;Where are they?&rdquo; She ran
to the window.</p>

<p>The masseuse followed more slowly, and three heads
were thrust out over the street.</p>

<hr class="l1" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II</a></h2>


<p class="cap"><span class="upper">A carriage</span> was driving up to the steps of
Fianti&rsquo;s.</p>

<p>To allow it to approach, a waiting motor
was obliged to move away, and in the short interval
that elapsed while this was being wound up and
started off the carriage paused almost immediately
opposite the window of Mrs. Vanderstein&rsquo;s bedroom;
she had thus a better view of its occupants than it had
ever previously been her fortune to obtain.</p>

<p>On the right of the barouche sat an elderly lady, with
grey hair piled high under a very small black hat. She
sat very upright and stiff, giving a little nervous start
when the horses moved forward impatiently and were
drawn up with a jerk by the coachman.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is the Princess,&rdquo; said Barbara, whose head
was touching Mrs. Vanderstein&rsquo;s.</p>

<p>Prince Felipe sat beside his mother, a middle-aged
young man of forty with a black upturned moustache
and an eyeglass. He had a cigarette in his hand and,
as they looked, he turned round and gazed after a
smartly dressed woman who was driving by.</p>

<p>On the back seat of the carriage sat two other men&mdash;gentlemen
in waiting, no doubt.</p>

<p>Mrs. Vanderstein&rsquo;s eyes were, however, fully occupied
with the Princess and her son.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t he handsome?&rdquo; she whispered to Barbara,
as if there were a danger of being overheard above the
rattle and din of the busy roadway.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span></p>

<p>But it almost seemed as if the words reached the ears
of the man she was watching, for, the motor in the
portico having at last got under way and left the road
clear for Their Highnesses, the Prince threw back his
head as the carriage moved on, and looking up met Mrs.
Vanderstein&rsquo;s eyes fixed admiringly on him.</p>

<p>She drew back her head in some confusion, but the
Prince was still looking up when the barouche disappeared
in the shade of the portico.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Madame! Son Altesse vous a reconnue!&rdquo; cried
Madame Querterot, her face wreathed in smiles.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He never saw me before,&rdquo; replied Mrs. Vanderstein,
retreating into the room. &ldquo;How odd that he
should have looked up just then! What a charming
face he has.&rdquo; And she subsided once more on the sofa,
her own face aglow with excitement and pleasure.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t move from the window, Barbara, whatever
you do,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Just think if we had missed
them!&rdquo;</p>

<p>As Madame Querterot resumed her rubbing, a knock
came at the door, and Mrs. Vanderstein&rsquo;s maid entered
bearing the jewels her mistress intended wearing that
night at the opera. As she set the cases down on the
dressing-table and busied herself in laying out the
various garments of her mistress&rsquo; evening toilet, she
cast from time to time disapproving glances in the
direction of Madame Querterot, whom, although a
compatriot, she disliked very heartily, considering that
in the privacy of Mrs. Vanderstein&rsquo;s chamber any
ministrations besides her own were unnecessary, and
having altogether a strong tendency to look upon her
countrywoman as an interloper, who had possibly an
eye to a share in various perquisites for which Am√©lie
preferred to see no other candidate in the field.</p>

<p>She took an elaborate gown from the wardrobe and
spread it out upon the bed together with divers other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
articles of attire. She placed a jug of hot water in the
basin and a jar of aromatic salts beside it.</p>

<p>She straightened several objects on the dressing-table,
which had no need of being made straight;
tilted the looking-glass forward and tilted it back
again; lifted up a chair and set it down with a thud;
and finally, despairing of ever witnessing the departure
of her dreaded rival, was about to leave the room when
her mistress&rsquo; voice called her back.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Am√©lie,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;just show me what necklace
you have brought up for me to-night. Is it the one
with the flower pendants or the stone drops?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Am√©lie carried all the cases over to the sofa; and
Madame Querterot left off rubbing while Mrs. Vanderstein
sat up and opened them one by one.</p>

<p>In the largest a magnificent diamond necklace,
imitating a garland of wild roses and their leaves,
glistened against its blue velvet background. The
other cases, when opened, displayed bracelets and a
diamond tiara, as well as rings and a pair of ear-rings
formed of immense single stones.</p>

<p>Mrs. Vanderstein shut them all up again and handed
them back to Am√©lie.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Take them down again to Blake,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;and
tell him I have changed my mind and will wear
the emeralds instead. They go better with that
dress.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, madame,&rdquo; sighed Madame Querterot, as Am√©lie
departed with the jewels, &ldquo;what marvellous diamonds!
Wherever one goes one hears the jewels of Mrs.
Vanderstein spoken of.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is true,&rdquo; said Mrs. Vanderstein, &ldquo;that my
jewels are very good. My dear husband had a passion
for them and collected stones as another man collects
bric-√†-brac. He never made a mistake, they say, and
my ornaments are rather out of the way in consequence.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
For myself I feel it an extravagance to lock up such a
vast amount of capital in mere gewgaws.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My poor Eug√®ne,&rdquo; said Madame Querterot, &ldquo;had
also this same enthusiasm for precious stones. He
loved so to adorn his wife with diamonds, that dear
soul! But with him it was, alas, more than an
extravagance. It was our ruin; for he was not a
connoisseur, like monsieur votre mari, and when the
crisis came and we would have turned my jewellery
back into money, behold, we were told that we had
been cheated in our purchases, and that, for the most
part, the stones were without value. Ah, the sad
day! As you know, madame, bankruptcy followed,
and we had to give up our beautiful <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">√©tablissement</i> in
Bond Street. It broke the heart of that poor Eug√®ne.
He never recovered from the blow and soon left me,
I trust for a happier world, by way, it goes without
saying, of purgatory,&rdquo; added the masseuse, crossing
herself like a good Catholic. &ldquo;Since that day I have
faced the troubles of this life alone, without friendship,
without sympathy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Here her emotion overcame Madame Querterot,
and she turned away for a moment with a display of
her handkerchief. She had omitted from her affecting
narrative the fact that &ldquo;that poor Eug√®ne&rdquo; had
perished by his own hand, on discovering the state of
his affairs; and she slightly trifled with the truth when
she asserted that it was his unfortunate craze for
covering his wife with jewels which had brought about
such a disastrous state of things. It was Madame
Querterot&rsquo;s own passion for the adornment of her
person that had resulted in the dissipation of Eug√®ne&rsquo;s
savings, and brought him, at the last, to see with
despair the total disappearance of the business, which
she had neglected and ruined.</p>

<p>Mrs. Vanderstein&rsquo;s kind heart was touched.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span></p>

<p>She had heard vaguely the reason of the Querterots&rsquo;
removal from their gorgeous Bond Street rooms after
the death of Eug√®ne, the incomparable hairdresser, and
it was from a creditable desire not to desert the
unfortunate that she continued to employ the little
Frenchwoman since the day of the catastrophe. But
no details of the affair had reached her, and she now
heard for the first time, and not without being sincerely
moved, the sad story of a man who, having spent his
all in lavishing tokens of affection on his wife, had in
the end reduced her to a state of poverty bordering on
want, and even left her to confront this terror in
solitude, as a result of his misdirected tenderness.</p>

<p>Considerably affected, she tried to speak words of
comfort to the poor woman.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is dreadfully sad,&rdquo; she murmured. &ldquo;Poor
Madame Justine, how sorry I am. Your poor husband,
I see well how he must have adored you and that what
he did was all for the best. But you are not absolutely
alone in the world, are you? Have you not a
daughter?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, it is true, madame, that I have a daughter,&rdquo;
replied Madame Querterot, wiping her eyes and
resuming her work.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And she is no doubt a great comfort to you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Children, madame, are at once a joy and a trouble,&rdquo;
returned the masseuse evasively.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hope your daughter has not caused you much
trouble.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She has given me nothing but worry since the day
she was born. Her childhood, her education, her
illnesses! Measles, chicken pox, whooping cough,
mumps, scarlet fever; she has had them all one after
the other.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But not while you have been coming to see me!&rdquo;
cried Mrs. Vanderstein, alarmed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah no, madame, all that is long finished,&rdquo; replied
Madame Querterot, &ldquo;but since then I have been
obliged to provide for her education, and every year
she has become more expensive. Now she is eighteen,
and you would imagine her anxious to repay some of
the expense and <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">ennuis</i> she has caused me during all
these years.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, no doubt,&rdquo; agreed Mrs. Vanderstein, &ldquo;she
will be a great help to you now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So one would think. But figure to yourself,
madame, what this young girl proposes to me to do with
her life. She desires to enter a convent and to spend
her days in good works rather than be of assistance to
her mother!&rdquo; and Madame Querterot laughed bitterly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think she ought not to take such a decisive step
at present,&rdquo; said Mrs. Vanderstein; &ldquo;at the age of
eighteen she can hardly know if a religious life is really
her vocation.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She is obstinate like a donkey, madame. Just
think of it, a young girl, healthy, not ugly; already she
has had offers of marriage. There is a young man, very
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bien</i>, very <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">comme il faut</i>, who demands her hand and who
thinks of nothing but her. But will she take him? No.
Not at all. We prefer to be a religious; and <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">voil√†</i>!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Madame Querterot, having finished her massaging,
was repacking the brown bag in which she had brought
her apparatus.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hope that you will amuse yourself at the opera,
madame,&rdquo; she went on, folding her apron and laying it
on top of the other things in the bag, the lock of which
clicked as she shut it down with an impatient snap.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A demain, mesdames,&rdquo; she concluded, taking up
the bag by the handle and giving it a shake as if she
only wished she could so shake her unsatisfactory child.
&ldquo;A cette heure-ci, n&rsquo;est-ce pas?&rdquo;</p>

<p>And with that she bowed herself from the room.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III</a></h2>


<p class="cap"><span class="upper">Mrs. Vanderstein</span> and Barbara hurried
over their dinner and were early in their
places in Covent Garden. Mrs. Vanderstein
always arrived before the orchestra had tuned up. She
had, like many of her race, a great appreciation of
music and did not like to miss a bar of the overture,
even though she had already heard the opera that was
being given so often that she knew it by heart.</p>

<p>She felt very much in a mood to enjoy herself that
evening, and till the first act was over leant back in
her chair with half-closed eyes, hardly moving at all,
and absolutely absorbed in listening to the wonderful
singers who were that night interpreting Puccini&rsquo;s
melodious work. Even the Royal box opposite barely
distracted her attention for more than a few moments.</p>

<p>Barbara Turner was not musical, but she, too, was
always pleased to go to the opera. She liked the sensation
of luxury, which enveloped her there even more
than elsewhere; she liked the feeling that the entertainment
offered them was costing a huge amount of money,
and therefore could only be witnessed by a privileged
few. Although she laughed at Mrs. Vanderstein&rsquo;s
passion for Royalty, she shared her simple satisfaction
in the knowledge that the box in which they were now
sitting was sandwiched between that occupied by the
Duke of Mellinborough on their left, and the one
tenanted by Sir Ian Fyves, the sporting Scotch
millionaire.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span></p>

<p>Barbara rejoiced in the exclusiveness obtainable by
the rich, therein differing from some other people who
depreciate the advantages of wealth on the grounds
that the largest fortunes may be made and handled by
the most vulgar, and that banking accounts are not in
these days the exclusive property of the refined, or even
of the intellectual.</p>

<p>Mrs. Vanderstein made no secret of the benefit to her
health derived from hours spent in the closest proximity
to the aristocracy, the air inhaled by a duchess being
separated from that which filled her own lungs merely
by the thinnest of partitions. She invariably occupied
the chair on the left-hand side of the box, so that the
space between her and her unseen neighbours might be
thought of in terms of inches; and it cannot be denied
that Barbara herself relished the thought of the
company of the great who surrounded her, heedless
though they might be of the pleasure they were providing.
It was not really to be expected, besides, that
the nearness of Sir Ian Fyves, whose horse had already
so easily won the Derby the year before, and who was
again the lucky owner of the favourite for the coming
contest, should leave unmoved the daughter of Bill
Turner, the trainer.</p>

<p>All Barbara&rsquo;s childhood had been passed at Newmarket,
and the talk of the racing men with whom her
father associated had been the first to fall on her
infantile ears. The horses in his charge had grown to
be her chief interest in life, as they were that of every
one she was brought in contact with; and at the age
of ten she knew as much about them&mdash;their points,
prowess, value, and chances&mdash;as any stable boy on the
place. On a small but truculent pony she followed her
father and his friends to the heath in the early mornings
and watched the morning gallops with a critical eye;
with the same edifying companions she pottered about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
the stableyard during most of the rest of the day, and
only when bed-time came&mdash;and it came at eight
o&rsquo;clock, for on that one point her father was firm&mdash;was
she reluctantly torn away.</p>

<p>All Mr. Vanderstein&rsquo;s horses were trained by her
father, and many a time the childish eyes followed them
to victory.</p>

<p>In earlier days, before Barbara had made her bow
upon the scene, Turner had been associated in various
affairs of business with Mr. Vanderstein, then plain
Mr. Moses Stein, familiarly known to his intimates of
those days by the endearing nickname of Nosey Stein;
sometimes in moments of rare affection, when some
particularly brilliant <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">coup</i> had just been brought off,
he was alluded to as Nosey Posey.</p>

<p>Mrs. Vanderstein, then Miss Ruth Hengersohn, had
changed all this. The name of Stein was repugnant to
her, though it seems a good enough sort of appellation
in its way; Nosey or Nosey Posey she could only think
of with a shudder; while the idea of being herself
known as Mrs. Nosey filled her with a burning determination,
which, as it cooled, hardened to the inflexible
consistency of chilled steel.</p>

<p>Before their marriage took place, Mr. Stein, who
always admiringly recognised, when he met it, a will
more adamant than his own, had at great trouble,
inconvenience, and expense changed his name for
that of Vanderstein, by which he was afterwards
known.</p>

<p>The enterprises, chiefly connected with the promotion
of companies, in which this gentleman had, in
his early, forgotten&mdash;and best forgotten&mdash;youth, the
assistance and co-operation of Mr. William Turner,
were in their nature precarious and not a source,
unfortunately, of the profit foreseen by those who set
out upon them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span></p>

<p>At the conclusion of one of them, indeed, things took
on a very unexpected complexion, assuming in the
twinkling of an eye so disagreeable a hue, that the
directors of the company, whose management was
suddenly the centre of attraction and which was in
danger of receiving a most unwelcome, if flattering,
attention from the public prosecutor, thought it best
to disappear with a rapidity and unobtrusiveness
highly creditable to a modest desire for self-effacement
at a moment when free advertisement was within the
grasp of each of them.</p>

<p>Luckily for Mr. Stein, his name did not appear among
those who sat on the board of this particular company
and he was able to pursue his way in a retiring and
profitable manner; but it was otherwise with his less
fortunate friend, Bill Turner.</p>

<p>It was to the search for this worthy though too
incautious person that the efforts of the authorities
were principally directed; and it was only by
returning once more, under an assumed name, to the
racing circles which he had during a short interval
forsaken for the city, and still further owing to the
absence of the chief witness for the prosecution, whose
whereabouts could not for a long time be ascertained,
that Turner was able to escape the fate which ought
assuredly to have been his.</p>

<p>He settled finally at Newmarket, and married the
daughter of a neighbouring squire, who never spoke
again to a child who could so far forget her father&rsquo;s
position and ignore his commands as to unite herself
to the more than questionable William.</p>

<p>The poor lady, however, took her revenge on her
relations, and her leave of a world in which she had
found time to suffer some disillusions, on the day that
saw Barbara ushered into the light; so that the little
girl was left to grow up entirely in that odour of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
stables which her father preferred, in his heart, to any
more delicate perfume.</p>

<p>It was not until she was ten years old that Turner
began to suffer from the attentions of blackmailers, but
these, having once discovered him, saw in him a mine
of gold which they fondly expected to prove inexhaustible.
Such, however, was not the case. After
a year&rsquo;s persecution the wretched man found himself
penniless, and on the advice of Vanderstein, the only
one of his old pals who did not ignore him in his trouble,
he left the country with precipitation and secrecy.</p>

<p>So little was his intention suspected that he eluded
all further detection and bolted successfully to South
America, where he remained untraced by undesirable
acquaintances and finally drank himself to death after
several years of the most gratifying obscurity.</p>

<p>Turner&rsquo;s only regret at leaving England was that he
could not take with him his little girl; but hampered
by the company of a child escape would have been
impossible, and he sorrowfully yielded to the representations
of Vanderstein on that point.</p>

<p>The Jew promised to take charge of Barbara in the
future, and assured Turner with every mark of
solemnity that as long as he or his wife lived the girl
should not lack a home. Turner, who knew that
Vanderstein never ceased to chafe under a sense of
obligations incurred in the early days of their struggles,
placed every confidence in the words, and had no doubt
that his friend would live up to his promises.</p>

<p>And Vanderstein did not fail to do so.</p>

<p>Barbara, whose grief at parting from her father was
intense and pathetic, was comforted as best might be
and sent to school at the select academy of the Misses
Yorke Brown at Brighton. Here she received the best
of educations in the company of about thirty other
young ladies, the daughters of well-to-do middle class<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
people. In their society she obtained a nodding
acquaintance with algebra, history, science, and literature;
with them she attended dancing classes, learnt
a little French and German, and disported herself on
the tennis court and hockey field. She roller-skated
and played golf, became proficient in the art of swimming,
and with a chosen and fortunate few rode daily
on the downs.</p>

<p>At the end of six or seven years she had grown into a
self-possessed, capable young woman, a little old for
her years perhaps, as was obvious to those who knew
her well, but to outward appearance still a mere child,
easily amused at trifles, and with a rare capacity for
enjoying life, which made her a delightful companion.</p>

<p>Her face had an innocent and helpless expression at
variance with her real nature, which was eminently
self-reliant and independent. She would never forgive
her mother&rsquo;s relations who had despised her father, and
at any mention of them her large blue eyes would
always flash resentfully.</p>

<p>Her relatives for their part made no effort to seek
her out and were quite content to leave her to the
Vandersteins&rsquo; tender mercies.</p>

<p>Before Barbara left school Mr. Vanderstein died,
leaving in his will a provision to the effect that his
widow was to continue the care of his friend&rsquo;s daughter,
either making her an annual allowance of ¬£500 a year
or taking her to live with her as friend and companion.
There was a further bequest of ¬£30,000 to Barbara,
which was to become hers on Mrs. Vanderstein&rsquo;s death.</p>

<p>This was not the only thing in the will which filled
Mrs. Vanderstein with indignation.</p>

<p>She found to her disgust that half the fortune, which
she had formed the habit of considering hers, was left
to young Joe Sidney, the son of her husband&rsquo;s sister.
This lady had committed the horrid offence of marrying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
a Christian, and to her, during her lifetime, the orthodox
and scandalised Moses never alluded. Her death
occurred a year or two before his own, and after it
Mr. Vanderstein had displayed a certain interest in his
nephew, but not enough to prepare his wife for his
preposterous action in regard to the division of his
money. Indeed, he expressed in the will his wish that
after her death it should all go to Joe, though he left
the final decision on this point to her judgment.</p>

<p>Old Vanderstein had amassed considerably over half
a million sterling during the latter and most prosperous
portion of his career, so that his widow was not
altogether the pauper she was fond of declaring herself;
but in the first shock of seeing her income divide
itself by two she decided to save the ¬£500 provided for
Barbara and to submit instead to the infliction of her
presence.</p>

<p>She had never seen the girl, who had, indeed, been
a subject of disagreement between her husband and
herself, but she was so easy-going and good-natured at
heart that a very short period of Barbara&rsquo;s society
had sufficed to change her prejudices and distrust into
a warm affection, and she soon looked on her as she
might have done on a younger sister.</p>

<p>There were occasions certainly when, if anything
annoyed her, she would not refrain from pointing out to
Barbara how much had been done for her and how
exaggerated had been Mr. Vanderstein&rsquo;s views in this
direction.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My dear husband,&rdquo; she would exclaim, &ldquo;would
have ruined himself, if he had lived longer, by his own
unbounded philanthropy. He was constitutionally
unable to say &lsquo;no&rsquo; to anyone, and goodness knows in
what difficulties he would have landed himself if time
had only been afforded him. How often he would
admit to me that certain people had tried to borrow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
from him and that he had let them have what they
wanted. In vain I begged him to be more firm. He
would make me promises, but I would soon discover
that he had been doing the same thing again. &lsquo;My
dear,&rsquo; he would reply to my reproaches, &lsquo;I have really
not the heart to refuse to help these poor young men.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Vanderstein did not bother his wife with details
of his private affairs, holding that women have no
concern with business; and he decidedly never thought
it necessary to mention that he used a certain discretion
in his benevolence, steeling himself against
more supplications than she suspected.</p>

<p>It was true, however, that he never refused to lend
money to such poor young men as were heirs to
entailed estates or could offer other satisfactory security
for the repayment of his kindness, and it was by these
unobtrusive charities that his fortune was collected.</p>

<p>Mrs. Vanderstein&rsquo;s prejudices against Joe Sidney
had also decreased very rapidly when she became
acquainted with that young man, as she did shortly
after his mother&rsquo;s death, and by the time this story
begins&mdash;that is to say, three years after she herself had
been left a widow&mdash;he had become a great favourite of
hers, although there were still moments when she
thought a little bitterly of the large sums he had
deprived her of by the fact of his existence. However,
she liked him well enough to let him know that it was
her intention to comply with Mr. Vanderstein&rsquo;s wishes
in regard to the ultimate disposal of his fortune, and
that her will constituted Sidney her sole legatee.</p>

<p>As she was only a few years older than himself and
of a robust health, there was every likelihood that this
provision would not affect his fortunes for many years
to come, or even that she might survive him.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV</a></h2>


<p class="cap"><span class="upper">When</span> that night, during the interval
between the first and second acts of the
opera, the door of the box opened and
Sidney made his appearance, Mrs. Vanderstein greeted
him with a beaming smile and the most sincere
pleasure.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How nice to see you, dear Joe,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I
didn&rsquo;t know you were in London.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I only came up from York last night,&rdquo; said her
nephew, &ldquo;or I should have been to see you before.
The Garringdons asked me to their box, which is more
or less under this, so I couldn&rsquo;t see if you were here,
but I thought you would be.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He sat down and began to talk about his doings and
to ask questions about theirs, Mrs. Vanderstein looking
at him meanwhile with a feeling of gratification at the
decorative effect on her box of this good looking
youth. She hoped the audience, or at least some
members of it, had noticed his entrance, and she
thought to herself that even inconvenient nephews
had their uses.</p>

<p>Joe Sidney was twenty-five years of age and his
father&rsquo;s son. The late Mr. Sidney had been a very tall,
fair individual, and Joe resembled him, showing the
merest trace of the Jew in the droop of his nose, which,
however, was not very marked. His eyes too, perhaps&mdash;but
why pick to pieces a young man who really was,
taken altogether, a very fine specimen of his kind?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
Though he had not, or scarcely had, inherited the
appearance of his mother&rsquo;s race, he showed much of its
sympathy with art and music; and his intelligence
was equalled by his prepossessing manner, which had
made him a favourite since his boyhood with nearly all
with whom he came in contact, and, combined with his
wealth, rendered him extremely popular in the cavalry
regiment in which he was a subaltern. He knew a
great many smart people whose acquaintance Mrs.
Vanderstein would have given her ears to make, and
from time to time he invited her to meet one or two
of them at a restaurant dinner or theatre, quite unconscious
of the pleasure he was giving; for the
very intensity of her longing made Mrs. Vanderstein
shy of letting this superior young relative guess at it,
and Barbara had never hinted to him at the weakness
of his uncle&rsquo;s widow.</p>

<p>Poor Mrs. Vanderstein! One pities her when one
reflects that if the good Moses had survived a few years,
till the advent of a Radical government which was
extremely short of sympathisers in the Upper House,
she might have lived to hear him called &ldquo;My Lord,&rdquo;
and have answered with beating heart to the delicious
salutation of &ldquo;My Lady.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She seized the opportunity afforded by Sidney&rsquo;s
presence now to gather information about the occupants
of the boxes facing them. Did Joe see anyone he
knew? Of course she knew by sight every one in the
Royal box, except that man behind the Queen. Who
was that? Sidney thought it was the Italian ambassador.
What a distinguished looking man! And in
the next box? Sidney didn&rsquo;t know. And the one
beyond that? He didn&rsquo;t know either. Mrs. Vanderstein
was disappointed in him. Well, who did he
know? Couldn&rsquo;t he tell her anyone?</p>

<p>&ldquo;Really,&rdquo; said Sidney, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see many, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
there are one or two. That woman with the red face
and the purple dress is Lady Generflex, and the man
two boxes off hers on the right is Sir William Delaplage.
Then that girl in pink who has just taken up her
opera glasses is Lady Vivienne Shaw, and the man in
the same box is Tom Cartwright, who was at Eton with
me. Down in the stalls there are one or two men I
know, and I think that&rsquo;s all. Of course there&rsquo;s old
Fyves, next door. You know him, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Vanderstein gazed with intent interest at the
people he pointed out; and then let her attention
wander back to the Royal box while Sidney talked to
Barbara.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you been racing?&rdquo; she asked him soon.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Off and on. I went to see my horse, Benfar, run
the other day. He came in easily last.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think that man can ride him well. He&rsquo;s a
good horse. I saw him as a two-year-old.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s something wrong somewhere, that&rsquo;s
certain. If I don&rsquo;t have better luck this year than I
had last I shall give up keeping race-horses,&rdquo; said
Sidney with decision.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, you mustn&rsquo;t do that,&rdquo; cried Barbara in a tone
of so much distress that Sidney laughed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why do you care?&rdquo; he asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I care a lot. I never see anything of racing people
nowadays, or meet anyone except you who knows a
horse from a centipede. If you give up racing I shall
feel that my last link of connection with the turf is
severed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you get my aunt to bring you down to
Epsom to-morrow?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, she wouldn&rsquo;t like it a bit,&rdquo; said Barbara
regretfully.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I daresay she&rsquo;d enjoy it enormously. Aunt Ruth,
why don&rsquo;t you come racing with me sometimes? Miss<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
Turner and I will show you the ropes and you&rsquo;ll
probably be plunging wildly by this time next week.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hate spending a hot day walking from the stand
to the paddock and back again,&rdquo; said Mrs. Vanderstein.
&ldquo;I hate horses and I hate seeing their heels
waving round my head on every side, which seemed to
me to be the case the only time I went to a race
meeting. Nasty vicious animals. The way they are
led about among the crowd by people who can&rsquo;t control
them is most dangerous, I consider.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I expect you saw one let off a kick or two out of
sheer lightness of heart,&rdquo; said Barbara. &ldquo;Horses are
darlings, really; I wish you knew them as well as I do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Vanderstein not only disliked horses herself,
but she strongly disapproved of Barbara&rsquo;s fondness for
them. The career of the late Mr. Turner had been
unedifying to such a point that even Mr. Vanderstein
had been unable to disguise entirely from his wife some
of its more notorious features, and Mrs. Vanderstein
would have been better pleased if she could have
persuaded herself that the girl had forgotten all about
the days of her companionship with so undesirable a
father.</p>

<p>She had, moreover, no sympathy for speculation in
any form, and especially mistrusted that which took
the shape of gambling on the turf. Her greatest friend
had married a man who had entirely ruined himself by
the practice of backing losers; and the sight of the
misery and privation that had, in this manner, been
brought on a woman for whom she felt a sincere affection
left on Mrs. Vanderstein one of those deep impressions
that determine many of our strongest opinions and
prejudices throughout life. To Mrs. Vanderstein
betting was one of the most unpardonable sins. It was
true that Mr. Vanderstein had kept a racing-stable
and she had never really forgiven him for not giving it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
up at her request. But he had always assured her
that he never betted.</p>

<p>She turned away without answering, and Barbara&rsquo;s
conscience&mdash;for she knew how much her friend disliked
the subject of the turf&mdash;made her think she
detected an impatient expression in the back of the
white shoulders and told her it would be better to
change the conversation. The temptation was too
strong, however, and she continued, dropping her
voice to a murmur:</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are going to Epsom to-morrow yourself?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Sidney, wondering why she leant so
confidentially towards him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I wonder if you would be very kind and put a
little money on a horse for me. Would it be too much
trouble?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not a bit. What horse is it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a tip Ned Foster sent me. He was one of my
father&rsquo;s grooms, you know, and I hear of him sometimes.
He used to be very good to me when I was a
child. I had a letter from him to-day begging me to
back Averstone. He says he&rsquo;s absolutely certain to
romp in on Wednesday.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How much do you want me to put on him?&rdquo;
asked Sidney.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t got much, I&rsquo;m afraid,&rdquo; said Barbara
ruefully, &ldquo;but I&rsquo;ve saved a little out of the pocket
money your aunt gives me. It&rsquo;s only ¬£20. I wish it
was more.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you going to risk your entire fortune?&rdquo; said
Sidney. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a pretty rash young lady, aren&rsquo;t
you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I must have a flutter. Besides, it&rsquo;s a dead
certainty. I&rsquo;d put a thousand on if I had it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What a fearful gambler! When you&rsquo;ve lost as
much as I have you&rsquo;ll go a bit slower.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you lost much?&rdquo; asked Barbara sympathetically.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m so sorry. Just lately?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, yes, since you ask me I don&rsquo;t mind telling you
that I have had some rather nasty blows during the
last few months. That brute, Benfar, has a lot to
answer for, my word!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll turn out a winner yet,&rdquo; said Barbara hopefully.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He might come in first if all the other starters
tumbled down,&rdquo; said Sidney, with an effort to treat the
subject lightly, &ldquo;but I&rsquo;m afraid before that happens I
shall have to shut up shop. Things can&rsquo;t go on like
this. I lost ¬£10,000 over the Lincolnshire meeting, and
that&rsquo;s only a drop in the ocean. But I don&rsquo;t know why
I&rsquo;m bothering you with my troubles,&rdquo; he concluded,
pulling himself up abruptly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am glad you tell me,&rdquo; she replied simply. &ldquo;I
am so very sorry that you have had such rotten luck.
You&rsquo;d better change it by backing my tip. Ned
Foster would never have advised me to put my all on
Averstone unless he knew it was a sure thing. He
really has a regard for me, I believe, and he often used
to say that the day would come when he&rsquo;d make my
fortune and his own. He doesn&rsquo;t approve of betting
as a general thing. He&rsquo;s a most steady, cautious kind
of individual.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wonder,&rdquo; said Sidney. &ldquo;I think perhaps I&rsquo;ll
have a last fling. What are the odds?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re long. Averstone&rsquo;s not supposed to have
a ghost of a chance. I think it&rsquo;s about 40 to 1 against
him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My word, just think if one had a few thousands on
him and it came off!&rdquo; said Sidney. &ldquo;The bookies
would all die on the spot.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It would be rather annoying for some one,&rdquo; laughed
Barbara. &ldquo;I hope it will come off.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid it would be too good to be true,&rdquo; said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
Sidney gloomily, &ldquo;but it would certainly save the
situation if it did. If I lost a very little more I&rsquo;d have
to leave the army.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is it as bad as that?&rdquo; asked Barbara, for the first
time realising the graveness of the position for Sidney.
&ldquo;How dreadful. I <em>am</em> sorry!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The young man laughed awkwardly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s awfully good of you,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been a
perfect ass, of course. If I could win back half what
I&rsquo;ve lost, I swear I&rsquo;d never back a horse again!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I expect your luck will turn,&rdquo; repeated Barbara
hopefully. She had all a gambler&rsquo;s instinct of
optimism.</p>

<p>But Sidney only laughed again rather recklessly as
he got up to go. The interval was over and the people
were hurrying back to their seats.</p>

<p>&ldquo;As the orchestra seems to be going to make another
effort,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I must get back to the Garringdons&rsquo;
box. Good night, Miss Turner; good night, Aunt
Ruth; I&rsquo;ll come and look you up in a day or two, if I
get over to-morrow without being obliged to put a
sudden end to my career.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What did Joe mean by his last remark?&rdquo; Mrs.
Vanderstein asked as the door shut behind the young
man&rsquo;s vanishing form. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand what he
meant about putting an end to his career.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He was telling me he has lost a lot of money lately,
racing,&rdquo; Barbara murmured rather reluctantly, for
she was not sure if Sidney would like her to repeat what
he had said. Still, she thought, it was surely absurd
for her to imagine that he would confide in her anything
he would hesitate to tell a relation. &ldquo;I suppose
he was trying to joke about that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s nothing to joke about,&rdquo; said Mrs. Vanderstein
severely. &ldquo;Not that I saw anything like a joke. I
think it&rsquo;s disgraceful, and I shall alter my opinion of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
him very seriously if he really has been betting. But
hush, the music is going to begin.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And she was soon entirely engrossed in listening to it.</p>

<p>But Barbara, to whose ear any but the most
elementary tunes presented nothing but a confused
medley of noises, wriggled rather impatiently on her
chair from time to time, as she waited for the act to
come to an end. Recollections that had lain dormant
for a long time, put away on some high shelf of the
wardrobe of memory, had been awakened again by
her conversation with Sidney and the letter she had
that day received from the old stableman. How happy
her childhood seemed when viewed now through the
flattering medium of the intervening years, which
obscured all that had been disagreeable, and magnified
the delights of her unrestrained wanderings and of the
free and easy company of her father and her father&rsquo;s
delightfully jocular friends.</p>

<p>How they used to laugh at each other&rsquo;s witty
remarks, and how she, too, had laughed, joining in the
mirth without understanding in the least what aroused
it but with enjoyment none the less complete on that
account. With closed eyes she leant back against the
wall of the box, her lips curved in a smile and her head
a little to one side in an attitude of listening. But it
was not the voices of the singers she heard. Instead,
the thud, thud of galloping hoofs sounded in her ears,
coming nearer and nearer, and, mixed with the creaking
of leather, the excited snorts of her pony and the
jingling of bits. She seemed to see around her the
bare, open spaces of the heath and the figures of the
watchers, among them herself, crouching low in the
saddle with her back to the bitter east winds that
sweep across the bleak Newmarket country in the
spring. Splendid bracing air, her father used to say,
and for her part she had never given a thought to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
weather. Happy, happy times! Oh, that they could
return. Why could not Mrs. Vanderstein give her that
¬£500 a year, thought Barbara, and let her take a
cottage, however tiny, within reach of a race-course and
within hail of a training stable? If only she had a
little money of her own. Money was everything, after
all. It meant liberty. If Averstone won his race it
would be something to the good.</p>

<p>Mrs. Vanderstein, turning to catch her eye at a
point in the music which, even more than the rest, gave
her a pleasure that asked to be shared, saw only the
closed lids and the smiling lips, and with a sensation of
gratified surprise said to herself that Barbara was at
last developing an appreciation of music.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_V" id="CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER V</a></h2>


<p class="cap"><span class="upper">When</span> Madame Querterot left the cool, airy
house, which reminded her so unpleasantly
of one which was associated principally in
her inmost consciousness with the sensation of corporal
punishment applied in no niggardly spirit, she turned
her steps towards her own home, which was situated
in the remotest part of Pimlico.</p>

<p>By the time she got off her bus and set out on foot
into the dreary labyrinth of dingy streets, in one of
which she lived, the shadows were lengthening fast
and the pavement was losing some of the blistering
heat accumulated during the day. Madame Querterot
climbed rather wearily the flight of steps before her
door. When she entered the little shop where Julie
sat sewing behind the counter, she passed through it
without a word to her daughter, and going into the
tiny room, which served as a sitting-room, threw herself
into the one arm-chair with something like a groan.</p>

<p>Julie, whose smile of welcome had faded on her lips
when she saw the expression on her mother&rsquo;s face,
bent again over her work, and for a little while all was
still in the tiny, two-storied house.</p>

<p>There was not room for many customers in the shop.
Julie often wondered what she would do if more than
two came in at the same time, but such an embarrassing
contingency had not so far occurred. Quite half the
space was taken up by the counter, on which stood a
tray containing hair-pins and hair-nets. In one corner<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
a space was curtained off for such clients as should
wish to have their hair dressed or washed. No one
had as yet requested this last service. In the window
Madame Querterot displayed a few superior articles
which had survived the wreck of the Bond Street
establishment.</p>

<p>There was a waxen lady, with fair hair wonderfully
curled and twisted, who obscured the light a good deal
as she stood with her shoulders disdainfully turned to
the interior of the room and her snow white nose close
against the plate glass, which separated her from the
street. Plainly she felt it a come-down to look out on
to this gloomy Pimlico roadway. Around her were
strewn combs and brushes, bottles of brillantine and
china pots containing creams for the complexion, curls
and tails of false hair&mdash;in some cases attached to gruesome
scalps of pink wax&mdash;and half a dozen elaborately
carved tortoise-shell combs, which the luckless Eug√®ne
had invested in in a fit of mistaken enthusiasm shortly
after his arrival in England, but which had never
received so much as a comment or an inquiry as to
price from any of those who had since looked on them.</p>

<p>They had remained, however, a source of pride to
Madame Querterot, who would often remark to Julie
what an air they bestowed.</p>

<p>Presently, after a glance at the clock, Julie put down
her work and came to the door between the two rooms.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are back, mother,&rdquo; she said, looking at her
gravely.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So it appears,&rdquo; snapped her mother without raising
her eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am afraid you must be tired,&rdquo; went on Julie
calmly. &ldquo;The day has been so hot. Will you not
take a glass of lemonade before supper?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you got a lemon?&rdquo; asked Madame Querterot
somewhat less crossly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Julie.</p>

<p>She opened the cupboard and taking out a lemon, a
tumbler, and a lemon squeezer, went about the business
of preparing a cool drink for her heated parent.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Has anyone bought anything to-day?&rdquo; Madame
Querterot asked when after a few minutes the beverage
was handed to her. &ldquo;Put a little more sugar in the
glass.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A boy came in for a bottle of hair-oil,&rdquo; replied
Julie, &ldquo;and a few women have bought hair-pins and
hair-curlers. It has been a dull day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We shall soon be in the street at this rate,&rdquo; said
Madame Querterot despairingly. &ldquo;One cannot live
on a few packets of hair-pins and a bottle of hair-oil.
No. If only we could move to a fashionable locality.
Here no one ever comes and we have but to die of
hunger.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We haven&rsquo;t been here very long. We may do
better presently. It is the customers whom you
massage that keep us from starvation.&rdquo; Julie propped
open the door into the shop and taking up her work
sat down by the table in the parlour.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bah! Who knows how long they will continue?
They have the skin of crocodiles, all of them. What
can I do with it? Nothing. And in time they will
find that out, and I shall be put to the door. What
will happen then? You, I suppose, think you will be
safe in your religious house. And your poor mother,
you will be able to mock yourself of her then, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">hein</i>!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mother, you know I shall not leave you while you
want me. I have not spoken of becoming a nun since
father died, have I?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your father!&rdquo; exclaimed Madame Querterot with
emotion. &ldquo;Your father was a poltroon. No sooner
did I need his assistance than he deserted me!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mother!&rdquo; cried Julie, and there was that in her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
tone which made Madame Querterot&rsquo;s lamentations die
away into inaudible mumblings.</p>

<p>The girl did not say any more, but went on quietly
with her sewing, till after a while her mother rose to go
upstairs.</p>

<p>At the door she paused.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bert is coming to supper,&rdquo; she said over her
shoulder. &ldquo;You have not forgotten that it is to-night
we go with him to the theatre? He will be here soon,
I should think,&rdquo; and she went on up the narrow stairs
without waiting for an answer.</p>

<p>Half an hour later, when they sat down to a cold
meal, which Julie had carefully prepared&mdash;for Madame
Querterot was particularly fond of eating and had seen
that her daughter early acquired the principles of good
cookery&mdash;they had been joined by the guest to whom
she had alluded.</p>

<p>This was a young man of an√¶mic aspect, with fair
hair that lay rather untidily across a high, narrow
forehead. His face, which was pale and thin, was not
at first sight particularly prepossessing. The contour
of it was unusually pointed, though the chin receded so
much that it could hardly be said to exhibit a point.
The mouth was weak and large and always half open,
so that the teeth, stained brown by the smoking of
continuous cigarettes, were not completely hidden when
he talked under the straggling little moustache, the
end of which he had an unpleasant habit of chewing.
The nose was prominent and looked too large for the
rest of his face, the eyes, dark and deep-set, seemed to
flash with unsuspected fires when talk turned on a
subject that interested him. It was they that
redeemed the whole man from total insignificance.
They were the eyes of an enthusiast, almost of a
fanatic. He did not talk much, but seemed content to
devour the food set before him and to gaze untiringly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
at Julie who sat opposite him at the small square
table.</p>

<p>Julie was a very good-looking girl in her way, which
was not at all an English way, although the English
language came more naturally to her lips than her
mother tongue. To tell the truth, she was not very
proficient in that, her mother and father having both
found it easier, after she began to go to school, to talk
to her in broken English. Indeed, after twenty years
or so of residence in London that language became as
natural to them as their own tongue, and Madame
Querterot&rsquo;s French had by now grown quite as anglicised
as that of many linguists in her adopted country.
She found, however, that many of her customers
preferred her to talk in broken English; they liked
to feel that here was some one come straight from the
gay city to do their pleasure.</p>

<p>Her daughter inherited her mother&rsquo;s oval face and
arched eyebrows, but there the likeness ceased. Julie
was tall while Madame Querterot was short; she was
dark, while her mother was fair, and of a fairness that
owed nothing to art. Julie had a straight, short nose and
a little rosebud of a mouth, her skin was dark but glowing
with health, and the brown eyes, set far apart under
the low brow, had a wide-open look of sorrowful surprise
as if she found herself in a world that failed
continually to come up to her expectations. Bert, it
was plain to see, found all this very much to his liking,
and was so taken up with the contemplation of it that
a great deal of Madame Querterot&rsquo;s conversation fell
unheeded on his ears, and his answers, when he made
any, were for the most part quite irrelevant.</p>

<p>Madame Querterot had by this time completely
recovered her good temper, or at all events displayed
the amiability habitual to her in intercourse with
strangers. She prattled away about the weather, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
letter she had that day received from her relations in
Paris, asked about Bert&rsquo;s work, and showed, and
possibly felt, great interest in his meagre replies.
Presently she began to talk about the occupation of
her own day.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is an old lady whom I visit for the massage,&rdquo;
she said, &ldquo;who would make you laugh to see. She is
ugly, she is fat, she has the complexion of a turkey!
Yet there is no one so anxious as she to become young
again. Was she ever beautiful? I do not know; but
it is certain that she will not be so again. Every day
I find her with a mirror in her hand and every day as I
leave her she takes it up again to see if there is any
improvement. For all I know she sits like that, gazing
at her unsympathetic reflection till the next day when
I come once more.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Madame Querterot paused and took a draught of her
lemonade.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A little more sugar, Julie, my cherished, and it
would be better still,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;In this country
sugar is less dear and you are unnecessarily careful of it.
If we were in France I would not say so; there, there
are <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">imp√¥ts</i>. But this, one must admit it, is the cheapest
place one can live in. That is why one finds here so
many Jews. Bah! the Jews! Why does one suffer
them? In England as in France one sees nothing
else; but even more in England since l&rsquo;affaire Dreyfus.
There is one lady to whom I go daily who would gladly
live in France, I think, if it had not become less disagreeable
for her race here since that business. But
perhaps it is not only on that account that she stays
here, now that I reflect. She is not one of those who
amuse themselves well in a republic.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How is that, mother?&rdquo; asked Julie without much
interest, while their guest, for his part, merely grunted
indifferently.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;She is more than a Royalist,&rdquo; said Madame
Querterot; &ldquo;she loves to see a head which knows how
it feels to wear a crown. She goes every day to watch
the Queen drive through the park. Mon Dieu! I
think she lives only for that. To-day a Prince passed
below her window, and as chance had it he looked up
at her as he went. She was mad with joy; one would
have said it was the happiest hour of her existence.
She said nothing, but I have my eyes! And it is a
woman who has everything to make her enjoy life.
She is not bad-looking, not at all bad-looking; for a
Jewess, even handsome; she is still young, and rich.
Oh, but rich!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Madame Querterot put down her knife and fork and
raised both hands in the air to convey the extent of the
wealth enjoyed by the lucky Jewess.</p>

<p>For the first time Bert displayed some interest in the
conversation, or monologue, as one might more
properly call it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s disgraceful,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;it ought to be put a stop
to. These people! They suck the blood of the poor!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Jews, yes; it is their <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">m√©tier</i>,&rdquo; agreed Madame
Querterot.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t refer to the Jew especially. What I&rsquo;m
alluding to at the present moment is all these useless
rich folk. The drones of the hive, as you may say.
These bloated capitalists who occupy the land that
ought by rights to jolly well belong to the people.
They&rsquo;d better look out for themselves, I can tell them.
There&rsquo;s a day coming when society won&rsquo;t stand it any
longer. In other words, we&rsquo;re going to drive them out.
Tax them out of their very existence. Do I make
myself perfectly clear?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bert glared triumphantly round as he brought his
hand down on the table with a conclusive emphasis
which made the glasses on the table jump nervously.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;This Mrs. Vanderstein of whom I speak,&rdquo; resumed
Madame Querterot composedly, &ldquo;has no land so far as
I know. She has only a house in London. But she is
rich all the same. One sees it at each step. In the
house, what luxury! Such pictures! such furniture!
such flowers! And automobiles, and boxes at the
opera! Such dresses! And above all, such jewels!
Oh, she is very rich, that one.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all the same,&rdquo; declared Bert, &ldquo;whether she
spends her money on land, or on clothes, or what not.
The point I want to impress on you is that she does
spend it, and that while she&rsquo;s living on the fat of the
land the rest of us may starve!&rdquo;</p>

<p>He helped himself as he spoke to another plateful
of <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">&oelig;ufs √† la neige</i>.</p>

<p>Julie watched him, the shadow of a smile playing
about her mouth.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you seen this lady&rsquo;s jewels, mother?&rdquo; she
asked. &ldquo;I adore precious stones.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have seen some of them,&rdquo; said her mother. &ldquo;To-night
her maid brought to her a necklace and bracelets
of diamonds, besides a coiffure and rings of great beauty,
no doubt without price. But she sent them away
again, saying that she would wear others. Those I did
not see, but it is certain that she has many, and all
wonderful. Every day she wears different ones and,
constantly, a string of enormous pearls. Without those
last I have never seen her. They are as large as
marbles and, to tell the truth, not much more pretty,
for my taste. When I tell you that she employs a
night watchman, whose sole duty is to patrol the house
every night, you will understand that the value of
what it contains must be large.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s just what these capitalists do,&rdquo; cried Bert
excitedly. &ldquo;They lock away thousands of pounds
like that when the money ought to be out in the world<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
paying just and equal wages. I should like to see it
made a criminal offence to wear jewellery.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But what would happen to the people who make
it?&rdquo; asked Julie. &ldquo;They would all lose their means of
earning a livelihood, is it not so? What would the
pearl fisher do, or those who dig precious stones out of
the earth? And the polishers and setters? Every
industry has a host depending on it for a demand for its
labour.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There would be less need for labour,&rdquo; said Bert
more gently, as was always the case when he spoke to
her, &ldquo;if the money was taken from the capitalists and
divided among the people.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Still&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; objected Julie again.</p>

<p>Madame Querterot, however, did not propose to
listen to an argument on the benefits to be expected
from Socialism; she had frequently heard all that
Bert had to say on the subject, and it had bored her
very considerably. She pushed back her chair and
stood up.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is half-past seven,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;we must put on
our hats for the theatre. It begins at nine, but we shall
take twenty minutes getting there, and I want to have
good places. Come and get ready, Julie.&rdquo;</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VI" id="CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI</a></h2>


<p class="cap"><span class="upper">The</span> two women went upstairs; Bert lit a
cigarette, and retired to smoke in the tiny
yard behind the house. Soon he heard
footsteps descending, and hastily throwing away his
cigarette he entered the little room again just as Julie
came into it. She had been quicker than her mother.</p>

<p>Bert did not waste time in preambles. He knew he
only had a few minutes at the best.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Joolie,&rdquo; he began hurriedly, &ldquo;why do you never
let me see you alone? Will you never be any nicer
to me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t I nice to you, Bertie? I don&rsquo;t mean not
to be.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You know quite well what I mean. I want you
to like me better. Oh, Joolie, you haven&rsquo;t a notion
how fond I am of you. It seemed to come over me all
of a sudden that day we walked in the Park, when
your mother for once didn&rsquo;t come with us. And since
then I haven&rsquo;t had a moment&rsquo;s peace. Not a single
solitary moment. Wherever I look, whether it&rsquo;s going
to the office, or at my work, or after it&rsquo;s done, I seem to
see nothing but you, Joolie, and I don&rsquo;t want to see
anything else either.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He moved closer to her and she retreated instinctively.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be afraid! I won&rsquo;t touch you,&rdquo; he said
with a certain bitterness. &ldquo;I know you can&rsquo;t bear the
sight of me, but I&rsquo;d give my life to make you happy.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Bert,&rdquo; she said, and her tone was full of
contrition. &ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t true that I can&rsquo;t bear the sight
of you. I like you very much, I do indeed. We are
such old friends. And it is so nice of you to like me so
much, but why can&rsquo;t we go on just being friends?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Joolie, Joolie,&rdquo; cried the young man. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t
understand. I love you, Joolie. I love you so much,
dear! Don&rsquo;t you think you could marry me some
day? There, I didn&rsquo;t mean to ask you now,&rdquo; he went
on quickly, seeing the look on the girl&rsquo;s face, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t
answer me now. I know what you&rsquo;re going to say and
I can&rsquo;t bear to hear it. Wait a while and perhaps I
shall be able to get you to care for me in time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Before she could reply Madame Querterot&rsquo;s foot was
on the stair, and in another moment she came in smiling
and arrayed in her best.</p>

<p>They set out without further delay and proceeded
by a succession of buses to the Strand. Descending
there, they made their way into one of the neighbouring
streets and took their places in a queue of people who
were already waiting for the doors of the theatre to
open.</p>

<p>Though not by any means the first to enter, they
secured good places in the pit and settled down in
them to await the beginning of the performance, each
of them, in his or her different way, prepared to enjoy
the evening to the utmost.</p>

<p>When at length the curtain rose they followed the
fortunes of the characters with a breathless intensity of
interest, and the play itself formed the subject of a
heated discussion afterwards, which lasted all the way
home, Julie maintaining that an honest course was
always desirable whatever excuses might be adduced
for other conduct.</p>

<p>Bert and Madame Querterot held, it appeared, more
elastic opinions, Bert declaring that there were people<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
it was a sin to leave in possession of their ill-gotten
gains, and Madame Querterot inclining to the view that
if anyone was so stupid as not to be able to keep what
they had, small blame need attach to those who were
clever enough to take it from them.</p>

<p>She upheld this contention by pointing out that no
one did blame the gentleman burglar who formed the
central figure of the play; the heroine herself, who was
assuredly in a high degree the pattern of all the virtues,
had easily forgiven his little lapses, slips which had
been made entirely for her sake.</p>

<p>&ldquo;For my part,&rdquo; she asserted, &ldquo;I admire a man of
that sort. Not that it is common to find one like him.
Most men have too high a regard for the safety of their
own skins. But one must admit that the young girl,
for whom this brave man took all those risks, was of
no ordinary beauty. It is possible that if there were
more like her there would also be more lovers, young
and ardent, ready to chance prison and the gallows to
win the wealth that should make her theirs. Ah, there
is no chivalry nowadays,&rdquo; and Madame Querterot
heaved a heavy sigh. Possibly she was thinking of the
base way in which Eug√®ne had deserted her in the hour
of need.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wealth is not always enough,&rdquo; said Bert disconsolately,
&ldquo;and, anyhow, wealth is an abomination
and a snare. In the ideal socialistic state there won&rsquo;t
be any such thing. All riches will be equally divided and
every one will have enough to live on, but no more. Anyone
who wants luxuries will just have to work for them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You look too far ahead, my young friend,&rdquo;
returned Madame Querterot philosophically. They
were walking up the dark streets that led to her house,
Bert having insisted on seeing them home in spite of
protests as to the lateness of the hour and the necessity
for his getting up early next morning.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;You have brains,&rdquo; she continued, &ldquo;and you use
them, which is not too general. But in this world it
is a mistake to show that one is clever. The stupid
only dislike one for differing from them in a way that
they cannot understand, and clever people actually
hate others who dare in this manner to resemble them.
If you wish to be loved it is best to appear foolish. No
one desires a lover too intelligent to care for their
opinions. If you wish to obtain respect do not show
yourself unusually brilliant. You will only be thought
eccentric or even mad. And finally if you want to
make money never allow anyone to suspect that you
are not perfectly an idiot. People will be on their
guard if they think they have to do with a clever man,
but if they think you a fool precautions will seem
unnecessary and it will be very easy for you to deal
with them to your own advantage.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bert listened to these remarks with more attention
than he usually displayed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you really think a man has more chance with a
girl if he is foolish and rich?&rdquo; he asked in a low tone.
They were walking behind Julie, the pavement having
narrowed so as to make it impossible to continue three
abreast.</p>

<p>Madame Querterot slackened her pace and fell back
a little.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Run on, Julie, my angel,&rdquo; she called out, &ldquo;and
prepare me a cup of coffee. I feel a kind of faintness
and will walk more slowly if Bertie will give me his arm.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bert made a gesture of annoyance, and would have
left her in pursuit of Julie, who hurried on as she was
told, but Madame Querterot clutched at his arm and
held him back.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Stay with me, I wish to speak to you,&rdquo; she said,
clinging so tightly to him that without roughness he
could not have shaken her off.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;What is it? I want to speak to Joolie,&rdquo; he said
crossly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You can speak to her any time; listen to me now.
You asked me a minute ago if I thought one had more
chance with a girl if one was rich.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; He spoke with returning interest. &ldquo;You
do think so, I suppose?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bert, let me speak. I must tell you that for some
time I have seen clearly that you have a tenderness for
my daughter. You wish to marry her, is it not so?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is the only wish of my life.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is easy to see. You show it in each word, in
your whole manner towards her. But let me tell you,
my friend, that in my country it is not only the consent
of a young girl that is sought by a would-be husband.
It would have been more <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">convenable</i> if you had
approached me, her mother, in this matter.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Madame Querterot, will you help me? Joolie
doesn&rsquo;t seem to care about me. Is there any other
man?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is no other man. Julie has an absurd idea
of entering into a religious house, but she is a dutiful
daughter and will not go against my wishes in that or
any other matter. As regards this question of marriage
she will, I am convinced, be guided by me. Ah, how
she loves me, that child! There is nothing she would
not do to please me. I say to you that Julie is not a
girl. She is an angel!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know that,&rdquo; grunted Bert; &ldquo;if you&rsquo;ll help me
with her, Madame Querterot, and there&rsquo;s ever anything
I can do to show my gratitude, why, you can take it
that I&rsquo;ll do it, that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, Bert, now is the time to prove that. Words,
words, words! But if it came to the point what would
you do, not to show gratitude, but to win the hand of
Julie? That is what I ask myself.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d do anything. By Jove, I believe there&rsquo;s
nothing I would stick at.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very well. Now, with me as your friend and ally
I think you might make certain that my daughter will
consent to the marriage. But I, Bert, will never agree
to her marrying a poor man. I have other ideas for
her, I assure you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You know I am poor,&rdquo; said Bert. &ldquo;I despise
riches, but for Joolie I wouldn&rsquo;t raise an objection to
them if they were in my reach. But you know very
well I shall always be poor as long as this beastly
capitalist government has its own way. Some day
perhaps things will change.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bert,&rdquo; said Madame Querterot, dropping her
voice, &ldquo;it is yourself who have suggested to me a way
by which one might become rich. Supposing I were
to tell you that I had a plan; that I knew a way by
which in a flash you might gain both riches and Julie,
and at the same time show your faith in the truth of
your own gospel? What then, Bert? Have you a
little courage, my boy? Girls do not understand your
modern ideas, that every one should be of an equal
poverty; they like to have money, they like what
money can give them. Did you not hear Julie say
this evening that she adored jewels?&rdquo;</p>

<p>They had reached the door of the shop and Bert
turned towards it without answering. But Madame
Querterot made as if to continue their walk, and after a
moment&rsquo;s hesitation he turned and paced beside her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I would give her all the diamonds in the world,&rdquo; he
said, &ldquo;if she wanted them and I could get them for her.
What do you suppose I care for my ideas, as you
call them? Nothing! Oh, nothing matters beside
Joolie! Still, I&rsquo;m hanged,&rdquo; said Bert, &ldquo;if I can see
what you&rsquo;re driving at.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I see a way,&rdquo; replied his companion, &ldquo;of doing a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
little good business. For it I need the assistance that
a young man like yourself can give. Some one with
courage, with determination, and who will not be
discouraged by a few apparent difficulties. But to
succeed the affair must be kept secret. It is indeed of
the most private character. Before I say more, swear
to me by your love for Julie that you will die before
you repeat a word of what I am going to tell you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I swear it,&rdquo; said Bert solemnly.</p>

<p>Madame Querterot gave one more quick, penetrating
glance at his pale face and, apparently reassured by the
light that burned in the dark eyes, began to talk again
in low, persuasive tones as they paced up and down
before the little house.</p>

<p>Julie came to the door and cried to them that the
coffee was ready; then despairing of an answer she
retired to her bedroom, where a light burned for a little
while; presently it was extinguished, and Julie in a
few minutes was peacefully asleep.</p>

<p>But still her mother and her lover walked and turned
on the pavement beneath her window.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VII" id="CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII</a></h2>


<p class="cap"><span class="upper">The</span> next day, Mrs. Vanderstein, busy with a
watering-can among the pots of roses that
during the season adorned her balcony, and
keeping a sharp look-out on the entrance to Fianti&rsquo;s
opposite, was disappointed not to catch another glimpse
of Prince Felipe of Targona whom she thought every
minute to see issue from beneath the portico.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What can keep him indoors on so fine a day?&rdquo;
she asked herself repeatedly, for again the sun smote
down on the city out of a cloudless azure.</p>

<p>Having spent the hour immediately after luncheon
in this vain expectancy, at the imminent risk of both
sunstroke and indigestion, she began to despair of her
hopes ever being fulfilled, and went back into the
drawing-room, where she threw herself dejectedly into
a chair.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If this weather goes on,&rdquo; she said to Barbara, &ldquo;we
might run over to Dieppe for a few days.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Vanderstein was very much in the habit of
making sudden excursions to the other side of the
Channel; whenever she was bored at home she
would dash off at a moment&rsquo;s notice to Dieppe or
Ostend.</p>

<p>Barbara enjoyed these trips, but sometimes wished
Mrs. Vanderstein would not make up her mind to
depart quite at the last minute, as she nearly always did.
It was awkward occasionally to have only half an hour
given one in which to pack.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Will you go to-day?&rdquo; she asked, with a shade of
anxiety in her voice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; Mrs. Vanderstein answered
wearily. &ldquo;I daresay I may.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Barbara walked over to the open window.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s Madame Justine coming out of Fianti&rsquo;s,&rdquo;
she remarked presently.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Really?&rdquo; said Mrs. Vanderstein, getting up and
going to Barbara&rsquo;s side. &ldquo;I wonder what she can
have been doing there?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Madame Querterot was hurrying along the pavement,
bag in hand. She looked up at the balcony and made
a little smiling bow in response to Mrs. Vanderstein&rsquo;s
friendly nod. Then she rounded a corner and was out
of sight.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What a good kind face she has,&rdquo; Mrs. Vanderstein
said as she turned back into the house. &ldquo;It would
cheer up anyone, that delightful smile. It always does
me good to see Madame Justine.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t think why you like her so much,&rdquo; said
Barbara, as she also came back into the room. &ldquo;I
don&rsquo;t think she looks particularly nice.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, Barbara,&rdquo; said Mrs. Vanderstein, &ldquo;at your age
you are no judge of character. Now I know a good
woman when I see one, and I do admire that one.
Look at the way she works day and night to support her
idle, ungrateful daughter.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t suppose she&rsquo;s so ungrateful as her mother
makes out,&rdquo; said Barbara. She seemed determined to
see no good in poor Madame Querterot.</p>

<p>In the cool of the afternoon the two ladies drove in
the Park and visited one or two of the houses of their
friends. It was past six when they returned home, and
for once the masseuse was waiting for them. She
came forward as Mrs. Vanderstein entered, and her
manner showed some excitement. In the background<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
hovered Am√©lie, who would have died sooner than
allow Madame Querterot to remain alone in her
mistress&rsquo; room, hinting darkly, if vaguely, to the other
servants that mysterious and terrible results would have
to be expected if such a liberty were accidentally
permitted.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, madame,&rdquo; cried Madame Querterot, &ldquo;I have
such amusing news. At all events I hope that you
will laugh and not be offended if I repeat it to you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is it, Madame Justine?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Figure to yourself, madame, that this morning I
received a summons&mdash;but, madame,&rdquo; said Madame
Querterot, checking herself on a sudden and casting
a look of scarcely veiled malice towards the other
occupants of the bedroom, &ldquo;what I have to tell you is
of a nature somewhat private. Is it possible that you
permit that I speak with you alone?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Mrs. Vanderstein; &ldquo;why not, if you
wish. Am√©lie, I will ring when I want you, please.
Barbara, do you mind going away till I call you?
Thanks so much. I must hear this amusing story of
Madame Justine&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Barbara and the maid lost no time in obeying, and
left the room; but while the one did so with alacrity,
her pride preventing her from showing any curiosity,
even for a moment, as to what Madame Querterot
might have to relate, Am√©lie was at no pains to conceal
the dislike, almost amounting to hatred, which shone
in her eyes as she fixed them in an angry stare on her
compatriot before she slowly moved towards the door.
Some day she hoped to be revenged on this woman, this
odious, talkative bourgeoise, for the way in which she
had wormed herself, if not into her mistress&rsquo; confidence,
at all events into such familiar impertinent terms with
her; when, if Mrs. Vanderstein could but be brought
to feel about her, in her bones, as Am√©lie felt, she would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
recognise her for a person to whom an honest woman,
let alone a lady at all <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">comme il faut</i>, would scorn to
address herself.</p>

<p>Her rage and indignation continued to augment as
the minutes passed and no bell summoned her back to
her duties. Though no fonder of work than her fellows,
Am√©lie&rsquo;s whole soul rose in revolt against the idea that
she could be dispensed with. And when at last, after
an hour&rsquo;s waiting, both she and Miss Turner were
recalled to the bedroom, one of them at least re-entered
it with murderous feelings in her heart, which she
vented by making faces at the masseuse behind the
ladies&rsquo; backs and vowing to herself that the day of
vengeance could not be much longer delayed.</p>

<p>As for Barbara, she was struck immediately she
returned to her friend by a suppressed excitement, a
restlessness of manner, which seemed to betray that
there had been something of personal interest in
Madame Querterot&rsquo;s confidences. She did not like,
however, to ask what the Frenchwoman had had to
tell in private, and as Mrs. Vanderstein did not volunteer
any information, but was very silent all the
evening, fully occupied apparently with her own
thoughts, Barbara was not sorry when bedtime
came.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you still think of running over to Dieppe?&rdquo;
she asked, as she said good night.</p>

<p>&ldquo;To Dieppe!&rdquo; cried her friend, &ldquo;good gracious,
no! I have all kinds of engagements, and you have
forgotten that my box is taken for the gala performance
of the opera on Monday. I shall certainly stay in
London for the present!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Clearly Mrs. Vanderstein had forgotten the half-formed
intention of the afternoon.</p>

<p>Well, that would not prevent her changing her mind
again, thought Barbara, and they might be off across<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
the Channel in a day or two in spite of to-night&rsquo;s
decision.</p>

<p>But days elapsed and no more was said on the
subject. Every evening saw Madame Querterot arrive
as usual; but now there was always a private interview
between her and Mrs. Vanderstein, which left
that lady flushed and smiling.</p>

<p>Barbara could not imagine what was happening to
cause all these changes. She disliked Madame Querterot
and vaguely resented the secret that she felt was
being kept from her. Why should Mrs. Vanderstein
have secrets with this horrid little Frenchwoman and
leave her out in the cold? How could she allow the
woman&rsquo;s familiarity? Barbara was both piqued and
disgusted at the whole trend of the matter.</p>

<p>On Sunday they walked in the Park with a certain
Mrs. Britterwerth, a friend of Mrs. Vanderstein.</p>

<p>After a day or two of clouds and rain, during which
people shivered and said it was like winter, the weather
had cleared again to the radiant brightness which
distinguished that summer from those preceding and
following it. The Park was gay with light dresses and
brilliant coloured parasols. The flowers, too, were at
their best&mdash;the rain had come at the right moment for
them and the beds were a vision of beauty&mdash;but they
received scanty attention, as usual, people flocking to
the other side of the road, where, to tell the truth,
it was very pleasant on the green lawns beneath the trees.</p>

<p>The three ladies strolled up and down in the shade.
Mrs. Vanderstein called it taking exercise, and did it
once a week for the sake of her figure. Mrs. Britterwerth
was really stout and would gladly have sat down
after a turn or two, but was not allowed to by her more
energetic friend.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Consider, my dear, what a lot of good it does us,&rdquo;
said Mrs. Vanderstein.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span></p>

<p>Here, presently, they were joined by Joseph Sidney,
and soon Barbara found herself walking on ahead with
him, while the two others followed them at a little
distance.</p>

<p>She had not seen him since the night at Covent
Garden, and she noticed with concern that he looked
worn and worried.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I saw that Averstone did no good,&rdquo; she said, as
soon as they were out of earshot.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Sidney shortly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you back him?&rdquo; she asked, and knew the
answer before he spoke.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh yes,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I backed him all right. He&rsquo;d
have won, I daresay, if I hadn&rsquo;t spoilt his chance with
my rotten luck.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Barbara walked on in silence for a minute.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry,&rdquo; she said at length. &ldquo;It was my
fault. I gave you the tip.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nonsense,&rdquo; he answered almost roughly. &ldquo;Your
money&rsquo;s gone too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you lose much last week?&rdquo; she asked abruptly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So much,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;that it&rsquo;s no good trying to
hide it from you. It&rsquo;s bound to come out in a few days.
The truth is that I&rsquo;ve lost every penny my uncle left
me and every sixpence I had before. Worse than
that! I&rsquo;ve lost money I can&rsquo;t pay, and I shall not
only have to leave the regiment, but&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; he broke
off bitterly and slashed with his stick at the grass.
&ldquo;Well, you know what it means,&rdquo; he finished lamely.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, it can&rsquo;t be as bad as that!&rdquo; cried Barbara.
&ldquo;Tell Mrs. Vanderstein. She will help you. How I
wish I had some money!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you think she would help me?&rdquo; asked Sidney.
&ldquo;She would let me blow my brains out first. You don&rsquo;t
realise, perhaps, what a violent prejudice she has
against betting. Look at this letter. I got it the day<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
after I saw you at the opera.&rdquo; He pulled from his
pocket a large sheet of blue writing paper on which
Barbara at once recognised Mrs. Vanderstein&rsquo;s unmistakable
handwriting.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="noi">
&ldquo;<span class="smcap">My dear Joseph</span>,&rdquo; it ran,
</p>

<p class="in3">&ldquo;I hope there is no truth in what I hear about
your betting on race-horses. It is a practice I deplore
with all my heart and I should be very sorry to see you
descend to such unprincipled depths. Without entering
upon a long dissertation, I must tell you that, unless
you henceforward sever all connection with bookmakers
and their kind, I shall think it my duty to
depart from your uncle&rsquo;s wishes and leave my money
away from you altogether. It pains me to write like
this and I trust it is unnecessary, but it is best to have
things understood.</p>

<p class="sgn">
<span class="sp3">&ldquo;Your affectionate aunt,</span><br />
&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Ruth Vanderstein</span>.&rdquo;
</p>
</div>

<p>Barbara read the letter in horror-struck silence.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the sort of help I should get from her,&rdquo; said
Sidney, as she gave it back to him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Something must be done,&rdquo; she repeated dully;
&ldquo;can&rsquo;t you borrow from some one?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been losing steadily for three years,&rdquo; replied
the young man, &ldquo;and I had to go to the money-lenders
long ago. I can&rsquo;t get another penny from them. It&rsquo;s
rather funny if you think of how my uncle made his
money, isn&rsquo;t it? But perhaps you don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; he
went on hastily, seeing the blank look on Barbara&rsquo;s
face. &ldquo;So that&rsquo;s how it is,&rdquo; he started afresh. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
all up with me, you see. I&rsquo;m absolutely done for
unless I can get ¬£10,000 by next week. I&rsquo;m pretty
desperate, I can tell you. There&rsquo;s nothing I wouldn&rsquo;t
do to get the money.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span></p>

<p>He spoke in emphatic tones, and several of the
passing crowd turned their heads to see who it was who
so loudly published the unfortunate state of his
financial affairs. Sidney was quick to realise the
attention he was attracting, and lowered his voice to a
more confidential pitch. Neither he nor his companion
specially remarked one among those who glanced up
at them on hearing the outspoken words, a small spare
man with a clean-shaven face and brown hair fading
to a premature greyness. Nor if they had done so
would either of them have recognised in this correctly
dressed, spick and span Londoner, whose well-fitting
morning coat and patent leather boots so exactly
resembled those worn by Sidney himself and nearly
every smart young man to be met with in the Park
that day, the well-known private detective, Mr.
Gimblet, the man most dreaded by the criminal class
of the entire kingdom.</p>

<p>Walking at a more rapid pace than they, he was in
the act of overtaking the couple as they strolled along,
when something in Sidney&rsquo;s voice, a note of despairing
recklessness more than the words themselves that he
uttered, aroused his interest and wakened his ever
ready curiosity. He continued to walk on without
slackening his speed, and did not look back until he
had advanced some fifty yards. Then he hesitated,
loitered a moment, and finally sat down on one of the
green chairs, which stood conveniently unoccupied,
just before Sidney and Barbara strolled unconcernedly
by.</p>

<p>Before they had passed, Gimblet had made a quick
survey of the young man&rsquo;s face, on which signs of
worry and anxiety were very plainly to be noted.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wonder who it is,&rdquo; he thought; and continued,
when they had gone on, to gaze meditatively after the
young people.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span></p>

<p>In his turn he failed to observe two ladies who came
up in the opposite direction to that in which his head
was turned. Mrs. Vanderstein observed his intent
expression as she approached, and following the
direction of his eyes murmured to her friend:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you see that man staring at Barbara? He
looks quite moonstruck. She attracts a great deal of
attention. Such a dear girl, I don&rsquo;t know what I
should do without her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are so good to her,&rdquo; murmured her companion.
&ldquo;The question is rather, what would she do without
you? But she is certainly an attractive young
person, especially to men. I wonder that you are not
afraid to let that delightful nephew of yours see so
much of her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>To Barbara, walking mechanically by Sidney&rsquo;s side,
it seemed suddenly as if some strange darkness hung
over the face of nature. The lightness of heart with
which she had gone forth out of the house, the high
spirits natural to her that constituted the only legacy
of any value which she had inherited from her father,
deserted her now to make place for distress on the
young man&rsquo;s account. Nor was it only at the thought
of the trouble that had fallen on him that she recoiled
horror-struck and that the sunlight took on a quality
of gloom, which made the present hour such a dismal
one and those of the future to appear encircled in a
dusk that deepened, as it receded, till it merged into
that utter obscurity over whose boundaries Joe seemed
already to be slipping and vanishing. It was the
effect of his disaster on her own life that chiefly terrified
and shocked her. What would she do without the
only man friend of anything like her own age whom she
knew in London and whose tastes so much resembled
her own? She would hear no more sporting gossip, be
cut off from her one remaining link with the racing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
world. What would she do without him if he disappeared
as he threatened? What would she do
without the only person in the world she cared to see?
The only person in the world she cared for.... The
knowledge came to her suddenly like a revelation and
she stumbled for a moment in her walk as she realised
with a flash of self-comprehension the full meaning of
her dread.</p>

<p>In that instant she saw and realised that to lose Joe
Sidney would be, for her, to lose all.</p>

<p>He, occupied in a recital of his troubles, noticed
nothing beyond his own almost unconscious relief in
speaking at length of the worries he had for so long
kept to himself. It was a comfort to have so sympathetic
a listener.</p>

<p>Still, not much comfort could be extracted even from
that, with the crisis in his life so real and so near at
hand, and he was soon repeating his earlier assertions
that it was no use talking, and that there was no hope
for him of anything but absolute ruin.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your aunt. She must, oh, she must help you!&rdquo;
Barbara heard herself saying again.</p>

<p>Again Sidney shook his head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t understand her. She will act in
accordance with her ideas. We Jews&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are not a Jew!&rdquo; Her voice was indignant.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My mother was a Jewess. You don&rsquo;t suppose I am
ashamed of it? We Jews have stronger convictions&mdash;opinions&mdash;principles&mdash;call
them what you like&mdash;than
Christians are in the habit of hampering themselves
with. We are more apt, I should say, to live up to our
theories. My aunt looks on gambling as the most
deadly of sins. Where you or I perceive a green track
and a few bookies, she sees, I do believe, a personage
with horns and a tail, brandishing a pitchfork. I&rsquo;m
not at all sure she isn&rsquo;t right. I am at least quite sure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
that if I could get out of this mess I&rsquo;d never go near a
race-course or have so much as a look at the odds again
as long as I lived. It&rsquo;s not much use saying that now,
is it? But believe me, help from Aunt Ruth is out of
the question. You may scratch it. This is the end
of all for me. I shall just have to go. Drop out, as
many better men have had to do before me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh don&rsquo;t talk like that,&rdquo; cried Barbara. She had
pulled herself together, and was thinking clearly and
rapidly. &ldquo;Listen to me. If you can&rsquo;t go to Mrs.
Vanderstein with the truth, can&rsquo;t you go to her with&rdquo;&mdash;she
hesitated&mdash;&ldquo;something else?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A lie,&rdquo; said Joe bluntly. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t wonder you
think I&rsquo;d not be above a lie if it could save me. But
can you suggest one with which I could go to her and
ask for ¬£10,000? If you can, let&rsquo;s hear it, for goodness&rsquo;
sake. But of course you can&rsquo;t. She&rsquo;s not an
absolute fool!&rdquo; He laughed again, a short, hard
laugh.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know Mrs. Vanderstein as well as I do,
though you are a relation,&rdquo; said Barbara. &ldquo;She has
weak points, you know. At least she has one weakness.
I wonder if you know what it is?&rdquo;</p>

<p>They had come to the Corner and paused by the
rails. Instinctively Barbara turned about, looking to
see if Mrs. Vanderstein were within earshot.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, look at her now,&rdquo; she cried.</p>

<p>Sidney, too, turned, and followed the direction of her
gaze.</p>

<p>His aunt and her friend had reached a point
some fifty yards behind them. Mrs. Vanderstein&rsquo;s
face was radiant. A rosy colour dyed her cheeks.
Her eyes sparkled, when for a moment she lifted them
and glanced in the direction of the roadway. But for
the most part they seemed to be modestly cast down and
Mrs. Vanderstein appeared interested solely in the toes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
of her shoes; these, though of the most pleasing
aspect, did not entirely justify the delight the lady
seemed to feel in them. She may, perhaps, have been
wondering whether or no they touched the ground, for
so lightly did she tread that a mere spectator might
have felt very grave doubts on the subject. She
looked, indeed, to be walking upon air. Even Sidney,
unobservant as he commonly was of the expressions of
people to whom he was not at the moment talking,
could not help noticing her unusual demeanour. Indeed
she looked the incarnation of happiness.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter with her?&rdquo; he asked, turning
again to the girl beside him.</p>

<p>For answer she made a movement of her hand
towards the road.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you see that?&rdquo; she inquired.</p>

<p>There was very little traffic in the Park on that
Sunday evening. A motor or two rolled through, but
they were few and far between. Joe saw nothing
remarkable or that could, to his thinking, in any way
account for his aunt&rsquo;s strange looks. One carriage
only was driving by, a barouche occupied by an elderly
lady and three foreign-looking men. There was
nothing about them to attract attention.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What in the world is there to see?&rdquo; he said, in
bewilderment.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In that carriage are Prince Felipe of Targona and
his mother,&rdquo; said Barbara, &ldquo;and Mrs. Vanderstein gets
as excited as that whenever she sees any kind of a
Royal personage. I don&rsquo;t think,&rdquo; she added truthfully,
&ldquo;that I ever saw her show it quite so plainly,
but you can see the effect they have on her. Royalty
is what really interests her most in life. You wouldn&rsquo;t
believe how much she is thrilled by it. It is an
infatuation, almost a craze.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I had no notion she was like that,&rdquo; said Joe, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
an air of some disgust. &ldquo;I should never have thought
she was such a frightful snob.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think it is snobbishness with Mrs. Vanderstein,&rdquo;
said Barbara. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s more a sort of romanticness.
But I don&rsquo;t suppose you understand. The
point is that there&rsquo;s nothing she wouldn&rsquo;t do to meet
any kind of a little princeling. And if she once met
him, there&rsquo;s nothing he could ask she wouldn&rsquo;t give.
After all,&rdquo; she went on in an argumentative tone, &ldquo;she
ought not to let you be ruined. I am sure Mr. Vanderstein
never would have. And ¬£10,000 is really so
little to her. Why, her pearls alone are worth far more.
What does a sum like that matter? It&rsquo;s only four or
five hundred a year. She wouldn&rsquo;t miss it a bit.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I daresay,&rdquo; said Sidney, &ldquo;but I don&rsquo;t see what good
that does me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you got a friend you can trust who would
stretch a point to help you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not a decimal point as far as cash is concerned. In
other ways, I daresay I have got one or two. They&rsquo;d
help me all right, poor chaps, if they&rsquo;d got any money
themselves.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not money. I mean some one who would take
a little trouble.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh yes, I think I can raise one of that sort. For
that matter,&rdquo; said Sidney, &ldquo;if you don&rsquo;t mind my
calling you a friend, I think no one could want a better
one. It&rsquo;s no end good of you to be so sympathetic and
let me bore you with my rotten affairs.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The girl turned away her face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course I am a friend,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;but you will
want a man, if my idea is any good. Now listen, I
have got a plan.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Barbara hesitated. She was very conscious that the
idea which had come to her was not one which would
commend itself to Joe. A few hours before she would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
have scornfully rejected the suggestion that she herself
could ever be brought to tolerate such an expedient,
but now everything was changed and all her convictions
of right and wrong were shaken and tottering, if not
entirely swept aside by the fear of the imminent danger
to the man she loved. Her one feeling now was that
at any cost the peril must be averted, and the question
of the moment was how to represent her design in such
terms as would prevail on him to see in it a path that a
man might conceivably follow and yet retain some
remnant of self-esteem.</p>

<p>Very carefully, choosing her words with deliberation,
she disclosed to Sidney the plan that to her seemed to
offer the only chance of setting his affairs in order. As
she expected, he refused at first to entertain the idea
at all; undismayed, she returned to the attack and
persisted, with Jesuitical reasonings and syllogisms,
in showing him that in the method she proposed lay
his only hope of obtaining the necessary money. Very
slowly and reluctantly he allowed himself to be
persuaded. No one could have listened for half an
hour to Barbara&rsquo;s cajolements without giving
way.</p>

<p>At the first sign of his weakening she redoubled her
efforts, and as she talked, refusing to allow herself to
be discouraged by Joe&rsquo;s objections and the difficulties
he pointed out, he gradually succumbed to her wheedling,
and once he had thrust his scruples into the
background became nearly as enthusiastic as she was
herself.</p>

<p>Before they parted the plan was worked out in every
point. It remained but to take the faithful necessary
friend of Joe&rsquo;s into their confidence. This, Joe told
her, had better be a subaltern in his regiment, by name
Baines, luckily in London at the present moment.</p>

<p>&ldquo;As long,&rdquo; he said with a return to former doubts,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
&ldquo;as old Baines is equal to the job. There&rsquo;s not much
he&rsquo;d stick at, though.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Barbara, and was silent a minute during
which the difficulties of carrying out her plan successfully
seemed to swarm around her with quite a new
vigour. &ldquo;If anything should turn up,&rdquo; she faltered,
&ldquo;to make this idea impossible, you will try telling Mrs.
Vanderstein the truth, won&rsquo;t you? It is a chance,
after all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, it can&rsquo;t make things worse, I suppose,&rdquo; he
agreed. &ldquo;I hope it won&rsquo;t come to that. I don&rsquo;t think
it will now; but if it does, I promise, if it pleases you,
that I will make a clean breast of it to her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; she murmured; and then as they
turned, &ldquo;there she is now, making signs that we should
go back.&rdquo;</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VIII" id="CHAPTER_VIII">CHAPTER VIII</a></h2>


<p class="cap"><span class="upper">When</span> they had driven away Sidney wandered
off beyond the outskirts of the crowd to a
lonely spot among the trees, where he
walked up and down, whistling softly to himself and
pausing from time to time to aim a blow at the head of
an unoffending daisy with his stick.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What an ass I am,&rdquo; he exclaimed presently in
heartfelt tones, but a listener who had fancied he was
alluding to his foolish gambling on the turf would have
been mistaken. His thoughts were engaged on quite
a different and much pleasanter subject.</p>

<p>How lovely she had looked! How sorry she had
seemed! What sympathy had shone in her eyes as
she listened to his discreditable troubles. How
determined she had been to find a way out; surely
she could not show such interest in the concerns of all
her acquaintances.</p>

<p>The way out, by the by, now that he thought of it
dispassionately, was hardly, perhaps, quite one that a
man could take after all and keep the little self-respect
left to him; but it was overwhelmingly sweet that
she should have lost sight so completely of all considerations
except the one of retrieving his fortunes.</p>

<p>He had always liked and admired her, of course, but
never till to-day had he realised what a loyal, brave
spirit dwelt behind those sea-blue, childish eyes.
There was no girl in the world like her, and was it
unduly conceited of him to think she must like him a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
little to show such agitation at the tale of his misfortunes?
And here he frowned and pulled himself
up short. What business had he, a ruined gambler, a
man whose career was, to all intents and purposes, at
an end, to think twice about any girl, much less to feel
so absurdly happy? He determined heroically to
banish Barbara from his thoughts, and in pursuance of
that excellent resolution walked off across the Park at
such a tearing speed that little boys whom he passed
asked derisively where the other competitors in the
race had got to.</p>

<p class="tb">. . . . .</p>

<p>It was on the following morning that Mrs. Vanderstein
made certain confidences to Barbara, thereby
dashing to earth the high hopes she had built of rescuing
Sidney from the ruinous meshes in which he had
entangled himself.</p>

<p>To that which Mrs. Vanderstein told her the girl
listened at first with incredulity, but a scoffing comment
was received with such extreme disfavour that she
dared not venture another; and finally, as she heard
more and fuller accounts and Mrs. Vanderstein,
chafing under a sense of her friend&rsquo;s disbelief, went so
far as to produce written evidence of the truth of the
story, Barbara was no longer able to deny to herself
that the astounding tale was undoubtedly not the joke
she had taken it for, but represented the plain facts of
the case.</p>

<p>With increasing dismay she heard all that Mrs.
Vanderstein had to tell her, seeing her hopes for Joe
vanish more completely at each new piece of information;
and when at the end of the tale her friend
reproached her for her lack of sympathy she had much
ado to prevent herself from bursting into unavailing
tears.</p>

<p>She was able, however, to summon enough self-control<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
to find some words of affection, which seemed
to fill the requirements of the situation; at all events
they seemed to satisfy Mrs. Vanderstein. The girl only
made one stipulation, and on this point remained
obstinate till the elder lady, failing to shake her
determination, was at last obliged to yield a reluctant
consent.</p>

<p>As soon as she could escape, Barbara, making the
first excuse that occurred to her, ran to her room,
where she pinned on a hat without so much as waiting
to glance in the looking-glass. Then, snatching up a
latch key, she let herself out of the hall door and
hurried to the nearest post office.</p>

<p>Several telegraph forms were filled in, only to be torn
up and discarded before she worded the message to her
satisfaction; and even when she handed it in under
the barrier&mdash;which protects young ladies of the post
office from too close contact with a public who might,
were it not for these precautions, be exasperated into
showing signs of violence&mdash;she was still regarding it
doubtfully, and her fingers lingered on the paper as if
reluctant to let it go.</p>

<p>It was addressed to Joseph Sidney, and covered
more than one form.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>&ldquo;Plan completely spoilt will explain meanwhile

will be in at teatime and it will be best to get it over
one way or another.&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<p>Would he come? she asked herself, as she went back
to the house; and all the afternoon the same question
echoed in her mind. Would he come? And, if he
came and did not succeed in enlisting Mrs. Vanderstein&rsquo;s
sympathies, what then?</p>

<p>There seemed no other possible course. In vain,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
as she sat beside her friend in the motor, she racked
her brains to imagine some way in which Joe could
still raise the money if this attempt failed. But she
had his assurance that he had already exhausted all
practicable means.</p>

<p>Mrs. Vanderstein wished to visit a shop in the
Strand, and their way to it led them past the theatre
that Madame Querterot had visited a week before, in
the company of her daughter and her daughter&rsquo;s
suitor.</p>

<p>Large placards ornamented the front of the house,
depicting some of the more thrilling episodes of the
play. These were varied by photographs of the
young actor who played the principal r√¥le. He was
portrayed in immaculate evening dress and in the
act of opening the safe; another picture showed him
snapping his fingers at the officers of the law; and yet
a third displayed him as he took&mdash;in the fourth act&mdash;the
heroine to his arms.</p>

<p>Mrs. Vanderstein and Barbara had seen the play,
which was making a roaring success, on more than one
occasion. Mrs. Vanderstein smiled as she observed
the posters.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is a good play,&rdquo; she said to her companion.
&ldquo;I can hardly help screaming when he escapes by the
window as the police burst into the room. It is almost
too exciting. And he, the gentleman burglar, you
know, is so good-looking. One can&rsquo;t help being on his
side, can one? And of course one is intended to be.
All the honest people are so terribly dull. Besides, of
course, he was a count and quite charming really. I
don&rsquo;t wonder the heroine forgave him.&rdquo; She put
down her parasol, as they turned into a shady street.
&ldquo;Do you know, Barbara,&rdquo; she went on, &ldquo;I think that
sort of play might do a lot of harm. It can&rsquo;t be right
to make dishonesty appear so attractive.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span></p>

<p>Barbara made no reply, and Mrs. Vanderstein,
glancing at her in surprise, was still more astonished
at the strange look in the girl&rsquo;s eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you think about it?&rdquo; she asked again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It depends on what you call harm,&rdquo; Barbara
answered slowly, and as they pulled up at their
destination the conversation came to an end.</p>

<p>They went home early and had barely finished tea
when Sidney was announced. He looked rather pale
and shook hands with Barbara without speaking as
she made a hasty excuse and left the room. Going into
another sitting-room, she waited in an agony of
suspense till the drawing-room door should open and
the interview be over for good or ill.</p>

<p>She had not long to wait.</p>

<p>Five minutes had scarcely passed before she heard
the sound of hurried footsteps descending the stairs,
and a moment later the front door banged behind
Sidney&rsquo;s retreating figure. At the same time a bell
pealed violently and, before it could be answered,
Barbara caught the sound of the swish of silken skirts
and the light tread of Mrs. Vanderstein&rsquo;s feet as she
ran down a few steps and called over the banisters to
the butler.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Blake,&rdquo; she called, as that portly person emerged
from the door leading to the basement. &ldquo;Is that you,
Blake?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, ma&rsquo;am.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Blake, I am not at home in future to Mr. Joseph
Sidney. You are never to let him come into this house
again. Do you understand?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very good, ma&rsquo;am.&rdquo; Blake&rsquo;s tones were as imperturbed
as if he were receiving an order to post a letter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And tell the footmen. I will not see him again on
any account whatever. Let it be clearly understood.
And, Blake, please telephone at once to Sir Gregory<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
Aberhyn Jones and say, if it is convenient to him, I
should like to see him immediately. Ask him to come
at once; or to come to dinner; or to the opera. No,&rdquo;
she corrected herself, &ldquo;not to the opera to-night. But
ask him to come and see me before I start if he possibly
can. It is most important.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, ma&rsquo;am.&rdquo; Blake showed no surprise: in
moments of distress his mistress always telephoned to
Sir Gregory Aberhyn Jones.</p>

<p>Mrs. Vanderstein, still in a state of great agitation,
retreated to write a letter before dressing for the opera,
a matter that demanded, to-night of all nights, both
time and undistracted attention.</p>

<p>When she descended to the dining-room all traces
of the disturbance caused by Sidney&rsquo;s visit had
vanished from her face; and her expression was again
one of joyful expectation, as it had been throughout the
day. After writing a hurried note, she had entirely
dismissed all memory of her husband&rsquo;s nephew.</p>

<p>It was natural that, in the contest with other
interests so enthralling as those which that evening
filled the mind of his uncle&rsquo;s widow, Sidney should
cease to occupy a place in Mrs. Vanderstein&rsquo;s thoughts;
should become, as he would have expressed it, an
&ldquo;also ran.&rdquo; What was more remarkable was the fact
that Barbara&rsquo;s countenance, when she took her place
at the early dinner, wore a look of pleasant anticipation
almost equalling that of her friend, very different from
the signs of anxiety and distress that had been visible
upon it during the earlier part of the day. Mrs.
Vanderstein had seen nothing of the weeping figure
which, after Joe&rsquo;s dismissal, lay with its face buried in
the pillows on Barbara&rsquo;s bed trying to stifle the great
sobs that shook it in spite of every effort, or even she,
preoccupied as she was, would have felt astonished at
so complete a recovery of spirits.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span></p>

<p>The change, indeed, had been instantaneous and
coincided with the moment, when, in the midst of her
grief, a sudden idea had flashed into Barbara&rsquo;s mind,
an inspiration, it seemed, that immediately smoothed
away all trouble and made plain the way by which
Sidney&rsquo;s difficulties should be removed. How was it
possible that she had not thought of it before? The
knowledge that Joe would never agree to the means
she proposed to take, that the persuasions and
sophistries of yesterday would be of no use here, that
it would be impossible even to broach the subject to
him, she swept from her impetuously. There was no
need that he should ever suspect her hand in the matter.
Care must be taken; she must act with prudence and
caution, and all would be well. One thought only
held her mind to the exclusion of all else, the wish to
protect and save this boy whom she loved from the
consequences of his own folly. Nothing was worth
considering except this. No fear of the possible
effect on her own life shook her resolution, for what,
she thought, is life or for that matter death, if it does
not imply the prolongation on the one hand, or, on
the other, the cutting short of the ties of affection.</p>

<p>She remembered the reckless air with which Joe had
said that this business would be the end of all for him,
and with a shudder she told herself that the words could
only have one meaning. If by sacrificing her life his
could be saved, she would not hesitate to give it.
Here plain to her eye was the opportunity to serve
him, and whatever the result might be to herself she
did not shrink from it. As she dressed for the evening,
Barbara smiled gladly to herself and sang softly a little
song. One thought disturbed her. Sidney was unaware
that his salvation was so near. She could not
bear to think of him now, worried and despairing.
Yet how could she reassure him without betraying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
herself and the great idea? With a little frown
Barbara mused over this question, as she stuck a
paste comb that Mrs. Vanderstein had given her into
the masses of her thick fair hair. Presently she
scrawled a few words upon a sheet of paper, and hastily
folding it into an envelope tucked it into the front of
her dress; then, fearing she was late, she ran down
the stairs.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sir Gregory Aberhyn Jones is out of town, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo;
Blake was saying as she entered the room.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh well, never mind now,&rdquo; said Mrs. Vanderstein.</p>

<p>Dinner that evening was a silent meal. Mrs.
Vanderstein, gloriously arrayed, sat smiling abstractedly
at nothing from one end of the small table. So
preoccupied was she that she forgot to eat, and Blake
was obliged to ask her repeatedly whether she would
partake of a dish before she could be brought to notice
that it was being handed to her. Once, as, recalled
suddenly to the present, she brought her thoughts
back with a start from their wanderings and turned
with some trivial remark towards Barbara, she noticed
with a faint feeling of amusement that the girl was as
much engrossed in her own imaginings as she was
herself, and was sitting absently pulling a flower to
pieces, her great eyes fixed vacantly on the shining
pearls that swung suspended from the neck of her
friend.</p>

<p>They started in good time, Barbara begging to be
allowed to stop for one minute at a post office on the
way.</p>

<p>She had, she said, forgotten to reply to an invitation,
and thought that now it was so late she had better send
an answer by wire. She gave the message, which was
already written out and in a sealed envelope, to the
footman, together with some money, and told him to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
hand it in as it was, and not to waste time in waiting
to see it accepted.</p>

<p>The man was back in a minute, and they drove on,
to take their places a few minutes later in the long string
of motors and carriages which was slowly advancing
to the doors of the Covent Garden opera house.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IX" id="CHAPTER_IX">CHAPTER IX</a></h2>


<p class="cap"><span class="upper">Mr. Gimblet</span> lived in a flat in the neighbourhood
of Whitehall. It was a fad of his to
be more comfortably housed than most
solitary men. The situation was conveniently near to
Scotland Yard, where officials were much in the habit
of requiring to see him at odd moments. The view
from the windows, overlooking the river, was delightful
to one of cultivated and artistic propensities, and the
rooms, large and well-proportioned, were capable of
displaying to advantage the old and valuable pictures
and furniture with which it was the detective&rsquo;s delight
to surround himself.</p>

<p>Much of his time was spent in curiosity shops, and
he was among the first to discover that former happy
hunting ground of the bargain seeker&mdash;the Caledonian
market. Many an impatient member of the Force,
sent round from the &ldquo;Yard&rdquo; to ask Mr. Gimblet&rsquo;s
assistance in some obscure case, had, after kicking his
heels for an hour or two in the hall, left the flat in
desperation, only to meet the detective coming up the
stairs with a dusky, dust-covered picture in his hand,
or hugging to his breast a piece of ancient china.</p>

<p>The younger son of a Midland family, which had
moderately enriched itself in the course of the preceding
century by commercial transactions in which a certain
labour-saving machine for the weaving industries had
played a large part, Mr. Gimblet had received the
usual public school education, and had spent two or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
three subsequent years at Oxford. His artistic
propensities had always been strongly marked, but his
family showing much opposition to his becoming an
artist, and he himself having a modest idea of his own
genius and doubting his ability to make his way very
high up the ladder of success by the aid of talent which
he knew to be somewhat limited, he had ended by going
into an architect&rsquo;s office, where he had worked with
interest and enjoyment for several more years. It was
by accident that he discovered his capacity for tracking
the most wary of criminals to his hiding place and for
discovering the authors of mysterious and deeply
plotted crimes. It happened that a workman employed
in the building of a house for which Gimblet had provided
the design was found murdered in circumstances
as peculiar as they were sinister. There appeared to be
no clue to the author of the deed, and after a week or
two the official investigators had confessed among
themselves that they were completely at a loss.</p>

<p>To Gimblet, visiting the scene of the crime in his
capacity of architect&mdash;but not without an unwonted
and hitherto unknown quickening of the pulse&mdash;a piece
of board nailed upright where it should have been
horizontal had proved immediately suggestive; and
its removal had brought to light certain hastily
concealed objects, which with one or two previously
unnoticed trifles had resulted in the capture and
ultimate hanging of the murderer.</p>

<p>This success had led the young man to feel an interest
in other mysterious affairs of the same nature; and it
was not long before he found the task of assisting the
police in such researches so much more profitable and
engrossing than his work as an architect, that he
gradually came to give more and more of his leisure to
the attempt to discover secrets and to solve problems
which at first sight seemed to offer no solution. By the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
time he was thirty there was scarcely a crime of any
importance that he was not called upon to assist in
bringing home to its perpetrator; and he had entirely
abandoned the pursuit of architectural learning for
that of criminal mankind.</p>

<p>He refused an invitation to become attached to the
official staff, although this was conveyed in terms that
were in the highest degree flattering, preferring to be
at liberty to decide for himself whether or no he should
take up a case. It was the sensational and odd that
attracted him; and he found that quite enough of this
came his way to make his occupation an extremely
profitable one.</p>

<p>Early on Tuesday afternoon Gimblet sat in his
dining-room, contemplating with some satisfaction a
large dish of strawberries and a pot of cream sent him
by a Devonshire friend. He was finishing a luncheon
which he considered well earned, as that morning he
had discovered in a narrow back street in Lambeth, and
purchased for a mere song, a little picture black with
age and dirt, in which his hopeful eye discerned a
crowd of small but masterfully painted figures footing
it to the strains of a fiddle upon the grass under a
spreading tree. Gimblet told himself that it was in all
probability from the brush of Teniers, and he had
propped it on the dining-room mantelpiece so that in
the intervals of eating he could refresh his eyes as well
as his body. Beside him lay the day&rsquo;s paper which
he had hardly had time to read before going out that
morning. He heaped cream upon his strawberries,
sprinkled them with sugar, and took, in succession, a
spoonful of the mixture, a look at his picture, and a
glance at the paper. With a contented sigh he
repeated the process.</p>

<p>At the moment he had no work in hand, and no one
more thoroughly enjoyed an occasional loaf.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span></p>

<p>It was good, he felt, to have nothing to do for once;
to have time to idle; to eat greedily delicious food;
to spend as many hours as he chose in the dusty recesses
of second-hand shops; to do a little painting sometimes;
even to be able to arrange beforehand to play
a game of golf. Gimblet had an excellent eye, and had
been rather good at games in early days. He seldom
had time now and, if he did go down to a golf ground
occasionally in the afternoons, had to resign himself to
play with anyone he could find, as he never knew till
the last minute whether he would be able to get away.</p>

<p>He thought of going this afternoon, and looked at
his watch. There would be a train from Waterloo in
half an hour. Just time to finish his strawberries and
catch it. That picture would look well when he had
cleaned it. He took up the paper again. It must have
been a fine sight last night at Covent Garden. And
what a list of singers. Gimblet, who loved music,
wished he had been there. &ldquo;The Verterexes might
have asked me to their box,&rdquo; he said to himself.
&ldquo;Life is full of ingratitude. After all I did for
them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And then it struck him that he had not done much
for the Verterexes after all, beyond nearly arresting
Mr. Verterex by mistake for a murder he had not
committed.</p>

<p>Gimblet laughed.</p>

<p>Then his thoughts reverted lazily to the pleasures of
loafing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think I shall give up work,&rdquo; he said to himself.
&ldquo;Why not? I have enough money put by to keep
me, with economy, in moderate comfort. Not quite
so many strawberries perhaps,&rdquo; he added regretfully,
taking another mouthful, &ldquo;but what I want is leisure.
Yes. I am decided I will do no more work. Let the
police catch its own burglars!&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span></p>

<p>He spoke aloud, and defiantly, addressing himself to
the picture.</p>

<p>At that moment his servant came into the room.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A gentleman very anxious to see you, sir,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;I have shown him into the library.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ask him to come in here if he&rsquo;s in a hurry,&rdquo; said
Gimblet. &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t finished lunch.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A minute later the man opened the door again,
announcing:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Major Sir Gregory Aberhyn Jones.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Major Sir Gregory Aberhyn Jones was a little man
with a pink complexion and a small brown moustache.
He was short and rather plumper than he could wish,
but carried himself very uprightly and with a great
sense of his own importance, glaring at those who
might be so obtuse as not immediately to recognise it
with such concentrated disapproval that it was usual
for the offenders to realise their mistake in the quickest
possible time. Behind a fussy, self-satisfied exterior
he hid a fund of kindness and good nature seldom to be
met with. Sir Gregory prided himself on his youthful
appearance, was, in his turn, a source of some pride
to one of the best tailors in London, took remarkable
interest in his ties and boots, trained his remaining hair
in the way it should go, and, though he was sixty-five,
flattered himself that he looked not a day over fifty-nine.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am in luck to find you, Mr. Gimblet,&rdquo; he said,
advancing with outstretched hand as Gimblet rose to
receive him. &ldquo;But this is a sad occasion, a very sad
occasion, I fear.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dear me,&rdquo; said Gimblet, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry to hear that.
But won&rsquo;t you sit down? I thought as my man said
you were in a hurry you would rather come in here than
wait for me. May I offer you some strawberries?
No? I&rsquo;m sorry I can&rsquo;t give you any wine, but I&rsquo;m a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
teetotaller, you know. Don&rsquo;t have any in the house.
Afraid you&rsquo;ll think me faddy. And now that the
servant has gone, may I ask what is the sad event which
has given me the pleasure of seeing you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bad habit, drinking water,&rdquo; commented Sir
Gregory, seating himself in an arm-chair by the
fire-place. &ldquo;But nowadays young men have no
heads. They can&rsquo;t stand it, that&rsquo;s what it is. Show
them three or four glasses of port and they say it
gives them a headache. Absurd, sir! The country
is rotten through and through. The men can&rsquo;t eat,
they can&rsquo;t drink, they can&rsquo;t even dance! They stroll
about a ball-room now in a way that would make you
sick. In my days we used to valse properly. But
they don&rsquo;t dance the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">deux-temps</i> any more, I&rsquo;m told.
They say it makes them giddy! Giddy! Rotten
constitutions, that&rsquo;s what we suffer from nowadays.
It&rsquo;s the same with all this talk of reforming the army.
Compulsory service indeed,&rdquo; the major snorted.
&ldquo;What should we want compulsory service for? In
my day one Englishman was as good as twenty
Germans or any kind of foreigner. At least he would
have been if we&rsquo;d had a European war, which as it
happened was not the case while I was in the Service.
But now there are actually people who think that if it
comes to a fight it would be an advantage for us to
have as many men as the enemy. They ought to be
ashamed of themselves, if there&rsquo;s any truth in it. No,
no, the army doesn&rsquo;t need reforming, take my word for
it. There are a few alterations which I could suggest
in the uniforms which would make all the difference in
the world, but except for that, what I say is, let
sleeping dogs lie.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Having delivered himself of these remarks, Sir
Gregory felt in his pocket, drew forth a cigar case,
selected a cigar and asked for a match.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you come to persuade me to your views on
compulsory service?&rdquo; asked Gimblet pleasantly as he
continued to devour his strawberries, which were now
nearly all gone. &ldquo;Because I&rsquo;m afraid it&rsquo;s no good.
You can&rsquo;t possibly convince me that its adoption is not
a vital necessity to the nation.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry to hear you think that,&rdquo; said the other,
&ldquo;for I have the highest opinion of your intellect.
Believe me, when you discovered the frauds that were
being perpetrated at the Great Continental Bank last
year, I marked you down, Mr. Gimblet, as the man I
should consult in case of need. And it is to consult
you that I am here. I said it was a sad occasion.
Well, it is sad for me, but I am not yet, as a matter of
fact, quite sure whether or no it is desperately so.
What has happened, in a word, is this. A lady to
whom I am deeply attached has disappeared.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Disappeared?&rdquo; said Gimblet, pushing back his
chair. He had eaten the last of the strawberries.
&ldquo;May I ask who the lady is&mdash;a relation of yours?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not exactly. She is a Mrs. Vanderstein, for whom,
as I have just said, I have a great regard, I may say an
affection. In fact,&rdquo; said Sir Gregory, leaning forward
and speaking in confidential tones, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mind telling
you that she is the lady I have chosen to be the
future Lady Aberhyn Jones.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Indeed. You are engaged to marry her?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not precisely engaged,&rdquo; admitted Sir Gregory,
with a slightly troubled look.</p>

<p>As a matter of strict accuracy, he had proposed to
Mrs. Vanderstein about three times a year ever since
the death of her husband; but Mrs. Vanderstein,
although tempted by his title, had already been the
wife of one man twice her age and did not intend to
repeat the experiment. Still, his friendship was dear
to her; he was the only baronet of her acquaintance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
and she liked to have him about the house. He had
been a director on the board of one of her husband&rsquo;s
companies, and, when introduced by him, her pretty
face and amiable disposition had quite captured Sir
Gregory&rsquo;s heart, so that he had cultivated Mr. Vanderstein&rsquo;s
society to such good purpose as to become a
constant habitu√© of the house in Grosvenor Street.</p>

<p>After Mr. Vanderstein&rsquo;s death he lost no more time
than decency demanded in proposing to his widow;
and, though she refused to marry him, and refused
over and over again, yet she did it in so sympathetic a
manner and was so kind in spite of her obstinacy that
Sir Gregory believed her absence of alacrity in accepting
his hand to be prompted by anything rather than a
lack of affection. She treated him as her best friend
and consulted him on every question of business, to
the wise conduct of which her own shrewdness was a far
better guide, and had imperceptibly fallen into the
habit of never making a decision of any importance
without first threshing out the pros and cons in conversation
with him. Nothing so strengthened her
faith in the soundness of her own judgment as his
disapproval of any course she intended to adopt.</p>

<p>&ldquo;For some reason,&rdquo; Sir Gregory continued after a
pause, &ldquo;Mrs. Vanderstein has never consented to an
actual engagement. It is that which makes me so
uneasy now. Can it be&mdash;Mr. Gimblet, I give you my
word I feel ashamed of mentioning such a suspicion even
to you&mdash;but can it be that she has fled with another?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He uttered the last words in such a tragic tone that
Gimblet, though he felt inclined to smile, restrained the
impulse, and, summoning up all the sympathy at his
command, inquired again:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will you not explain the circumstances to me a
little more fully? When did the lady vanish? Have
you any reason to think she did not go alone? Was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
there some kind of understanding between you, and
what did it amount to?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will be perfectly frank with you,&rdquo; said Sir
Gregory, &ldquo;much the best thing in these cases is to be
absolutely candid. You agree with me there? I
thought you would. At the same time where a lady is
concerned&mdash;you follow me? One must avoid anything
that looks like giving her away. But in this case there
is really no reason why I should conceal anything from
you. Mrs. Vanderstein has never accepted my proposals.
On the contrary she has refused to marry me
on each of the occasions when I have suggested it to
her. You ask me why? My dear sir, I cannot reply
to that question. Who can account for a woman&rsquo;s
whims? Not I, sir, not I. Nor you either; if you will
allow me to say so.&rdquo; Sir Gregory&rsquo;s hands and eyes were
uplifted in bewilderment as he considered the inexplicable
behaviour of woman in general and of
Mrs. Vanderstein in particular. &ldquo;But I have no
doubt that in time she would have reconsidered her
decision,&rdquo; he went on puffing at his cigar, &ldquo;that is to
say I <em>had</em> no doubt until this morning.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And what happened then?&rdquo; asked the detective.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I came up from Surrey, where I had been paying a
week-end visit,&rdquo; pursued his visitor, &ldquo;arriving at my
rooms at midday. My servant at once informed me
that Mrs. Vanderstein had sent a telephone message
yesterday evening, begging me to go immediately to
see her and adding that it was most important. I
only waited to change into London clothes, Mr.
Gimblet, before I hurried to her house in Grosvenor
Street. And when I got there, what did I hear?
&rsquo;Pon my soul,&rdquo; exclaimed Sir Gregory, taking his cigar
out of his mouth, &ldquo;you might have knocked me down
with a feather!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You heard that the lady had disappeared?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Exactly. Not been seen or heard of since last
night. Drove away from her own door, they tell me,
in her own motor car; and has never come back from
that hour to this.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did she leave no word as to where she was going?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;None whatever. She dined early, of course, on
account of the opera.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The opera! In that case what makes you think
she didn&rsquo;t go there?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course she went. Didn&rsquo;t I say so? She drove
off to Covent Garden and that&rsquo;s the last that&rsquo;s been
heard of her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You interest me,&rdquo; said Gimblet. &ldquo;Was she not
seen to leave the opera house?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know about that,&rdquo; said Sir Gregory. &ldquo;I
found the servants very much disturbed; and very
glad they were, I may say, to see me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She has probably met with some accident and has
been taken to a hospital,&rdquo; suggested Gimblet. &ldquo;Have
any inquiries been made?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I rather think they have been telephoning to the
hospitals, but I told them not to communicate with
the police till I had seen you. Wouldn&rsquo;t do, you
know. She would dislike it extremely, especially if it
turns out as I fear and she has gone off with some other
man.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t see why she should have done that,&rdquo; said
Gimblet. &ldquo;She was her own mistress, I suppose, and
had no need to conceal her movements. Depend on
it,&rdquo; he went on, for the anxiety on Sir Gregory&rsquo;s face
moved him to pity, &ldquo;she will be found at one of the
hospitals; and I advise you to make inquiries at
them. A woman, alone as she was, would be carried
to one of them if she were taken ill or met with a slight
accident that prevented her for the moment from
giving her address.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;But she was not alone,&rdquo; urged Sir Gregory. &ldquo;Miss
Turner, her companion, was with her, of course.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Indeed,&rdquo; said Gimblet, &ldquo;you said nothing of there
being anyone with her. And what has Miss Turner to
say on the subject?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s not there. She&rsquo;s vanished too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Really,&rdquo; said the detective. &ldquo;This is getting
interesting. That two ladies should set out for Covent
Garden opera house on a gala night and never return
from it, is, to say the least, slightly unconventional.
Now, before we go any further,&rdquo; he went on quickly,
&ldquo;what do you wish me to do in the matter?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I want you to find Mrs. Vanderstein, naturally,&rdquo;
returned Sir Gregory, staring at him in astonishment;
&ldquo;I feel the greatest anxiety on her account, the more
so since you consider her likely to have met with an
accident.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But if, as you seem to suspect, the lady has gone
off deliberately, will she not be annoyed at our seeking
her out? Will she not be angry with you for trying
to discover her movements if she wishes them unknown?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I daresay she&rsquo;d think it dashed impertinent. But
I can&rsquo;t help that. She may be in need of me; in fact,&rdquo;
cried Sir Gregory with sudden recollection, &ldquo;I know she
is! Don&rsquo;t I tell you she telephoned for me last night?
A most urgent message. That proves she wishes for
my help in some matter of importance to her, and how
can I assist her without knowing where she is?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;As you say,&rdquo; said Gimblet, &ldquo;it does look as if she
did not wish to leave you unacquainted with her
whereabouts. Well, I have nothing to do just now and
if you wish me to make inquiries I will do so with
pleasure, though I do not think it will prove to be an
affair altogether in my line.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank &rsquo;ee. Thank &rsquo;ee,&rdquo; mumbled the old soldier<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
with his cigar between his teeth. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I
want. Now, how are you going to set about it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am going to ask you a few questions first. You
have not yet furnished me with that comprehensive
clear account in which the trivial details which look
so unimportant and may yet be of such moment are
never omitted: the lucid narrative so dear to the
detective&rsquo;s heart. I do not think, if you will pardon
my saying so, that I am likely to get it from you, Sir
Gregory.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sir Gregory glared, but said nothing; and Gimblet
continued, with a smile:</p>

<p>&ldquo;To begin with, who is Mrs. Vanderstein?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The widow of a Jewish money-lender.&rdquo; Sir
Gregory spoke somewhat shortly. He considered
Gimblet&rsquo;s remarks disrespectful.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Rich, then?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Does she live alone in Grosvenor Street?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A young lady, Miss Barbara Turner, lives with
her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And who is she?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She is the daughter of an old pal of Vanderstein&rsquo;s.
A man who used to train his racehorses at Newmarket.
He was a bad lot and had to fly the country long ago.
Dead now, I believe.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Has Miss Turner any money of her own?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Old Vanderstein left her a good large sum, ¬£30,000
I think it is, but Mrs. Vanderstein has a life interest in
it. The girl has nothing as long as she lives with Mrs.
Vanderstein, who, however, I have no doubt, is most
generous to her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suppose you know Miss Turner well? What is
she like?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, she&rsquo;s a very ordinary girl, rather pretty some
people think, apparently. I don&rsquo;t admire the robust,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
muscular type that is fashionable nowadays. Mrs.
Vanderstein is very fond of her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That means you don&rsquo;t like her yourself?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sir Gregory hesitated. It was not in him, really, to
dislike anyone without very much provocation, but he
always had an idea that Barbara was laughing at him,
and he cherished his dignity.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t suppose there&rsquo;s any harm in the girl,&rdquo; he
grunted at last.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Has Mrs. Vanderstein the full control of her
fortune?&rdquo; asked Gimblet, after a quick look at him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I believe she has, absolutely. But if you think I
was after her for her money,&rdquo; exclaimed Sir Gregory
in an angry tone and half rising as he spoke, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re
dashed well mistaken!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Gimblet hastened to reassure him on this point and
he sat down again, still grumbling.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was Vanderstein&rsquo;s expressed wish that all the
money should ultimately be left to his nephew, young
Joe Sidney,&rdquo; he explained, &ldquo;and I am sure his widow
would not disregard his ideas on that point.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The dining-room faced south-west, and the afternoon
sun, creeping round, already shone full on the
small square panes of the casement windows, so that
the temperature of the room was rapidly rising to an
intolerable warmth. Gimblet thought of the train
that was to have carried him to the golf links. It
would have been unbearably hot in it, he told himself.
And the disappearance of a wealthy lady from her
house in London was sufficiently unusual to excite his
curiosity. Already his vivid imagination was seething
with guesses and speculations. His resolution to do
no more detective work was utterly forgotten.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is Mrs. Vanderstein like to look at?&rdquo; he
asked abruptly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She is quite young,&rdquo; began Sir Gregory, &ldquo;about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
your own age, I should say. She is not very tall and
has dark hair and a perfect figure, not one of those
great maypoles of women one sees about so much now,
but beautifully proportioned and just right in every
way. She has wonderful brown eyes and a smile for
every one. I think she is most beautiful,&rdquo; concluded
her old friend simply.</p>

<p>Gimblet got up.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will give instructions about having inquiries made
at the hospitals,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;though it does seem hardly
likely that both ladies should have been hurt, without
some news of it having come before now. And then
let us go round to the house. I should like to see the
servants and hear what they may have to tell. I hope
there may, even now, be some tidings awaiting you
there.&rdquo;</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_X" id="CHAPTER_X">CHAPTER X</a></h2>


<p class="cap"><span class="upper">There</span> was no news of the missing ladies in
Grosvenor Street; but Gimblet interviewed
all the servants and heard several facts,
which gave him food for thought.</p>

<p>It was from Blake, the butler, that he received most
information. It was Blake himself, looking heartily
scared, with half his usual pompousness driven out of
him by his anxiety, who opened the door to them and,
on hearing from Sir Gregory who it was that accompanied
him, begged Gimblet to allow him to speak to
him for a few moments. They went into the morning-room,
a cheerful white-walled apartment, gay with
books and flowers, and Blake addressed himself to the
detective.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m very glad you&rsquo;ve come, sir, I am indeed. Sir
Gregory will have told you, sir, that Mrs. Vanderstein
and Miss Turner, who lives here with her, went out
last night to the opera and have not returned. I
have been very uneasy about them and at a loss to
know what to do, sir, for Mrs. Vanderstein mightn&rsquo;t
like me to inform the police if so be that she&rsquo;s gone
away on purpose. But I never knew her to go away
without informing me of the fact or without any luggage
and leaving no address, though she does go off very
sudden sometimes to spend a week or so in foreign
parts, Dieppe being her favourite, I may say.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Indeed,&rdquo; said Gimblet, &ldquo;was Mrs. Vanderstein in
the habit of going abroad at a moment&rsquo;s notice?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;She went very sudden, when the fancy took her,
sir, but not so sudden as this. I&rsquo;ve known her say
at lunchtime to Miss Turner, &lsquo;My dear, we will go to
Boulogne by the 2.20 from Charing Cross,&rsquo; which,
lunch being at one o&rsquo;clock, didn&rsquo;t leave much time for
packing, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, it wouldn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; agreed Gimblet.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But in such cases,&rdquo; continued Blake, &ldquo;the maid
would often be left to follow with the luggage, the
ladies taking no more than what they required for the
night. But nothing was said to the maid yesterday on
the subject, and I can&rsquo;t think Mrs. Vanderstein would
ever go off like that anywhere, sir, in her evening dress
and diamonds.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course, it being a gala night at the opera, she
would be wearing jewels,&rdquo; Gimblet assented.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir, and that&rsquo;s partly what makes me feel so
upset, sir; I&rsquo;ve never known Mrs. Vanderstein to
wear so many jewels on one occasion. It would have
been well worth anyone&rsquo;s while to rob her last night,
sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Really. What was she wearing? Had she
valuable jewels?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Indeed, yes,&rdquo; broke in Sir Gregory, &ldquo;the Vanderstein
jewels were famous.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; repeated Blake; &ldquo;beautiful jewellery
indeed. A great responsibility, sir, in a household.
But I have them always in a safe in the pantry, where
I sleep myself, and if I go out in the daytime it&rsquo;s never
without one of the footmen stays in the room all the
time I&rsquo;m away. At night we have a night watchman
always on the premises, sir, and it was him that first
alarmed me this morning. He came to my door about
five o&rsquo;clock and knocked me up. &lsquo;What&rsquo;s the
matter?&rsquo; I called out, thinking at first what with sleep
and one thing and another that the house was on fire.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
&lsquo;She haven&rsquo;t come in yet,&rsquo; he said, and it was a few
minutes before I understood what he was driving at.
And then I didn&rsquo;t really feel anxious; though we&rsquo;d all
thought it very strange last night, when Thomas, the
second footman, who had gone with the motor to Covent
Garden, came back saying that he&rsquo;d received orders
that the car wasn&rsquo;t to go back to fetch the ladies at
all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What? the car was not to go back after the
performance?&rdquo; exclaimed Gimblet.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, sir, orders were given to that effect. Still, I
thought possibly they were coming home with some
friends, and even this morning I said to myself that
perhaps they were staying the night at a friend&rsquo;s house,
having for some reason not been able to get a cab home.
I had no doubt I should get a telephone message at any
moment, which would explain the whole of the circumstances.
But the morning passed away without our
hearing anything whatever, and by the time Sir
Gregory called I was just about getting ready to go
out and make inquiries at the police station.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Gimblet considered in silence for a few moments.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you noticed anything unusual of late,&rdquo; he
asked, &ldquo;in the habits or demeanour of anyone in the
house?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, nothing unusual beyond the fact that Mrs.
Vanderstein seemed to be enjoying uncommonly good
spirits. I also thought, but it might be it was only
my fancy, that you couldn&rsquo;t say the same of Miss
Turner. Yesterday she appeared to be very much
down on her luck.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did the idea of an accident occur to you?&rdquo; asked
Gimblet. &ldquo;Have you inquired at any of the hospitals?&rdquo;
&ldquo;I telephoned to St. George&rsquo;s, sir, but with no result.
I didn&rsquo;t know where else to make inquiries.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I understand,&rdquo; said the detective presently, &ldquo;that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
Mrs. Vanderstein has relatives and friends living in
London. Did you communicate with any of them this
morning?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, sir, I did not. I had already telephoned to Sir
Gregory last night and heard he was out of town.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is there no one else to whom you could have
appealed for advice? I understand that Mrs. Vanderstein
has a nephew or nephew by marriage. Does he
live in London?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, sir, his regiment is quartered in the north of
England. But it is true,&rdquo; Blake stammered, with
some appearance of reluctance, &ldquo;that Mr. Sidney is
off and on in London, according as he is able to obtain
leave, and I believe he is up at the present moment.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should have thought you would have telephoned
to him to-day. Did it not occur to you to do so?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Blake hesitated again. He looked from Gimblet to
Sir Gregory, then let his eyes roam to the window and
round the room as if help might be hoped for from some
unlikely source. Finally, they once more encountered
those of the detective and, under that compelling gaze,
he spoke.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I did think of it,&rdquo; he faltered, &ldquo;I should have done
so if it had not been for one thing. Mr. Sidney came
to the house yesterday afternoon and, I don&rsquo;t like to
mention it, sir, but I am afraid that he had words with
his aunt. I have no idea what it was about, sir, but he
only stayed a few minutes and as soon as he was gone
Mrs. Vanderstein called me and gave me strict orders
not to allow him to enter the house in future. She
seemed very much put out about something and I am
sure she wouldn&rsquo;t like me to have any communications
with Mr. Sidney now. It isn&rsquo;t my place to allude to
such a thing at all, but in the peculiar circumstances,
sirs, I hope you will excuse my saying that Mrs. Vanderstein
appeared to me to be very much put out indeed.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Quite so,&rdquo; said Gimblet, &ldquo;in the peculiar circumstances
your proper course is to tell me everything you
can, whether it bears on Mrs. Vanderstein&rsquo;s failure to
return home or not. I shall be less likely to go astray
after some false scent if I have a thorough knowledge
of the private affairs of these ladies, and there is no
knowing what trifling detail may not turn out to be
useful. Now about these jewels, can you tell me what
your mistress wore last night? I should also like to
see the place you keep them in.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Blake conducted them to the pantry. A small safe
let into the wall contained a quantity of jewel cases,
for the most part empty. The butler gave Gimblet a
list of what they had contained.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I never knew Mrs. Vanderstein to wear so many
ornaments at once,&rdquo; he repeated. &ldquo;She would mostly
wear her pearls and a necklace and perhaps a tiara and
a few bracelets and rings, but last night besides these
she had the two diamond necklaces sewn on to her
dress, and the emerald set, which takes to pieces so as
to make one big ornament, was sewn on it too. I don&rsquo;t
suppose there were many ladies at the gala performance,&rdquo;
said Blake, with some pride, &ldquo;who wore
better jewels than she did&mdash;unless it was the Queen
herself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Gimblet requested to be taken over the house, and
in the various sitting-rooms he hunted for some evidence
of a documentary character to show that Mrs. Vanderstein
had not intended to return on the previous
evening. He looked on the mantelpieces for an
invitation which should have been stuck up there, on
the writing tables for something of the same kind.
But though cards for different entertainments were
not wanting&mdash;most of them bearing well-known Jewish
names and conveying invitations to musical parties&mdash;there
was nothing suggesting that the ladies were to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
attend one on Monday night. He noticed the subtle
odour that hung about the rooms, and his scrutinising
eyes noted with delight the many beautiful and rare
objects of Mr. Vanderstein&rsquo;s collection.</p>

<p>He would gladly have lingered to examine the
pictures that decorated the walls, and the priceless
china, which stood on cabinets against the white
panelling. But, deferring this pleasure, he continued
his methodical search in the expectant company of Sir
Gregory and the half-scandalised Blake, who could
not decide in his own mind whether he was doing
right in allowing a detective, even one so well known
as Mr. Gimblet, to turn over his mistress&rsquo; correspondence
in this unceremonious fashion. When the detective&rsquo;s
search led him to the door of Mrs. Vanderstein&rsquo;s
bedroom, Blake felt himself unable to remain with him
any longer, and summoning Am√©lie from her workroom
he turned over to her the duty of keeping an eye on
these doubtful proceedings.</p>

<p>The news of the detective&rsquo;s presence had spread
through the house like wildfire, and Am√©lie for her
part was burning to assist the great man. Quite
unhampered by such scruples as those which were felt
by the worthy butler, she dragged open drawers, threw
wide the doors of cupboards, thrust any letters she
could find into Gimblet&rsquo;s hands and invited him to
verify for himself the information, or lack of it, which
she volubly imparted. She knew there was nothing
enlightening in the letters and did not hesitate to say
so. She had read them all long ago.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That poor lady,&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;they have assassinated
her to rob her of her marvellous jewels. Ah, but of
that I am well convinced,&rdquo; she declared, nodding her
head with gloomy satisfaction. &ldquo;She wore too many&mdash;it
was to tempt Providence.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span></p>

<p>Gimblet asked her for a list of the jewels and
received the same that he had had from Blake.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And will you describe to me what clothes Mrs.
Vanderstein wore,&rdquo; he asked, &ldquo;and also those of Miss
Turner?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Madame had on a dress of white <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">mousseline de
soie</i>, all <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">diamant√©e</i>,&rdquo; Am√©lie told him, &ldquo;ce qu&rsquo;elle √©tait
belle avec cette robe-l√†! Over it she wore a magnificent
cloak of <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">cr√™pe de Chine</i> and silver lace. The cloak is
mauve in the daylight, but in the evening one would
say that it was pink. She had on silver shoes and white
stockings and carried an antique fan of great value.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And Miss Turner?&rdquo; Gimblet was writing down her
description in his notebook.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mademoiselle also was dressed in white, but with a
dress much more simple. She had a cloak of flame-coloured
brocade that Madame gave her on her
birthday. It is lined with white chiffon; nothing can
be more chic.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As she spoke she glanced in surprise at Gimblet,
who was standing in the middle of the room, his head
thrown back, his nostrils expanding and contracting.
As each succeeding drawer had been pulled out he had
stood there, sniffing appreciation. The vague scent
that clung about the lower part of the house was more
penetrating here, and with each disturbance of Mrs.
Vanderstein&rsquo;s belongings grew stronger. There were
flowers about the room, tea roses in many bowls of
shining glass; but their faint sweetness was drowned
beneath the more powerful smell that pervaded the
air.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your mistress uses a delicious perfume,&rdquo; said
the detective. &ldquo;Did she always have the same one?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It smells good in here, is it not?&rdquo; said Am√©lie.
&ldquo;Yes, Madame uses always the same perfume. See,
here it is on her table. It sells itself very expensive,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
but with one drop one may perfume a whole dress.
Everything that Madame touches smells of it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Gimblet went to the dressing-table and took up the
bottle she indicated; he lifted it to his nose and,
removing the stopper, took a long, deep sniff. Then
recorking the bottle he put it down again with a glance
at the label. &ldquo;Arome de la Corse,&rdquo; he read, and
below, the name of a French perfumery celebrated for
the excellence and high prices of its products.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Madame is an admirer of the great Napol√©on,&rdquo;
explained Am√©lie helpfully.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who does not share her admiration?&rdquo; rejoined
the detective. &ldquo;And now may I see Miss Turner&rsquo;s
room?&rdquo;</p>

<p>In Barbara&rsquo;s chamber his stay was short. Here was
no arresting perfume, very little suggestion of feminine
personality. The room was more like that of a boy.
Photographs adorned the walls; a few books lay about.
A couple of letters were on the table; one was a bill.
The other, which Gimblet perused under the sympathetic
eyes of Am√©lie, ran as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="noi">
&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Dear Miss Turner</span>,
</p>

<p class="in3">&ldquo;I put the money on Averstone as you said. So
sorry he wasn&rsquo;t placed. He got away badly and had
no luck from the start. In haste,</p>

<p class="sgn">
<span class="sp2">&ldquo;Yours sincerely,</span><br />
&ldquo;<span class="smcap">J. Sidney.</span>&rdquo;
</p>
</div>

<p>&ldquo;Thanks, I think that is all I want just now,&rdquo; said
Gimblet, and he turned to leave the room. But
Am√©lie was in no mind to let him go like that. She
had hoped for some confidences, that she might have
a theory to retail downstairs.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If Monsieur will listen to my idea,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I
will tell him what I believe has happened to Madame.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
She has been killed for the sake of her jewels. That is
what I think. And it would be prudent before making
so many inquiries that one should look for her on the
floor of her box at the opera. It is probable that she is
there, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">la pauvre</i>, just as they struck her down and left
her!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank you for your suggestion,&rdquo; replied Gimblet
gravely. &ldquo;I assure you that I will not neglect to
visit the box. But I think that the bodies of two
ladies, &lsquo;struck down&rsquo; in it, would have called forth
some expression of astonishment on the part of the
caretakers.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Monsieur is laughing at me,&rdquo; began Am√©lie in
injured tones, but Gimblet was already half-way down
the stairs.</p>

<p>On the landing outside the drawing-room door Blake
was still hovering.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, there you are,&rdquo; Gimblet said. &ldquo;Can I see the
second footman now? Thomas, I think you said he
was called.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Thomas, being summoned, proved to be a tall lad
possessing an honest and ingratiating smile, adorning
a fair and open countenance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was you, I think,&rdquo; the detective said to him,
&ldquo;who accompanied the motor last night when it left
here with the two ladies?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; said Thomas, &ldquo;I did, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And you were told the car would not be required
again after the opera?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can you remember Mrs. Vanderstein&rsquo;s exact words
when she gave you the order not to return?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t Mrs. Vanderstein who told me, sir,&rdquo; said
Thomas, &ldquo;it was Miss Turner. &lsquo;Mrs. Vanderstein
says she won&rsquo;t have the car again this evening,&rsquo; she
said, and, &lsquo;do you understand, Wilcox?&rsquo; she says&mdash;that&rsquo;s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
the chauffeur, Wilcox is; she come running down
to speak to him just as he put the clutch in and we was
moving off&mdash;&lsquo;You&rsquo;re not to come to fetch us to-night
after the opera,&rsquo; I heard every word of course as plain
as Wilcox did. &lsquo;Very good, miss,&rsquo; he says, and she
ran back through the swing doors. Mrs. Vanderstein
had gone straight in and I didn&rsquo;t see her again. We
was very surprised, Wilcox and me, as it was the first
time that Mrs. Vanderstein hadn&rsquo;t had the motor
to bring her home that either of us could remember.
But orders is orders,&rdquo; concluded Thomas with an
engaging smile at Mr. Gimblet, who ignored it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank you, that will do for the present,&rdquo; he said;
and, when Thomas had gone, turned once more to
Blake.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How long has Wilcox been in Mrs. Vanderstein&rsquo;s
service?&rdquo; he asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He was with Mr. Vanderstein before he married,&rdquo;
replied Blake. &ldquo;The same as I was myself, sir.
Wilcox was a groom in the old days, but they had him
taught to drive the motor some years ago. He&rsquo;s a
most respectable, steady man, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thanks, I should like to see him,&rdquo; said Gimblet.</p>

<p>Wilcox, it appeared, was in the house at the moment,
having come round from the garage to hear if there was
any news, and Gimblet had him in and cross-examined
him. His story was the same as Thomas&rsquo;, with one
small addition.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Was there anything that struck you as the least
unusual?&rdquo; Gimblet asked him. &ldquo;Did you notice
anything in the appearance of either of the ladies, or
overhear anything they said to each other as they got
in or out of the car, that was not perfectly natural?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, sir, I did not,&rdquo; said Wilcox stolidly. He was
rather a fat man with a very horsey look. &ldquo;Not that
I paid any heed to what they might be saying so long<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
as it wasn&rsquo;t to me they said it. As far as I remember,
Mrs. Vanderstein got into the car and Miss Turner after
her, and &lsquo;To Covent Garden&rsquo; one of them says to
Thomas, and Miss Turner calls out, &lsquo;Just stop at a
post office on the way.&rsquo; And so we did.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; said Gimblet, &ldquo;you stopped at a post office,
did you? Was that quite in the usual course? And
which post office did you stop at?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was not in the usual course,&rdquo; admitted Wilcox,
&ldquo;in fact, I don&rsquo;t remember doing it on the way to the
opera before. But Miss Turner had a telegram to send.
We stopped in Piccadilly and she gave the form to
Thomas to take into the office. After that we drove
straight on to the opera house.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Thomas, recalled, remembered handing in the
telegram, certainly. Didn&rsquo;t know why he hadn&rsquo;t
thought of mentioning it before. Miss Turner gave
him a sealed envelope with &ldquo;Telegram&rdquo; written
outside it, and told him to give it with some money to
the young person in the office, and not to bother about
waiting for the change, as they were in a hurry. He did
as she said, and that was all he could tell about it.</p>

<p>Not much information to be collected from Thomas.
Possibly Gimblet&rsquo;s face showed a trace of disappointment,
for the footman added in a regretful tone:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m very sorry, sir, that I didn&rsquo;t open the envelope
so as I could tell you what the telegram was, sir; but
the ladies being in a hurry I didn&rsquo;t scarcely have time.
If I&rsquo;d known it was important, or anyway if I&rsquo;d had a
minute or two to myself, I&rsquo;d have taken a look at it.
I&rsquo;m very sorry indeed, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Gimblet dismissed him somewhat peremptorily.
He felt that he was taking an unreasoning dislike for
the apologising Thomas, so anxious to ingratiate
himself.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XI" id="CHAPTER_XI">CHAPTER XI</a></h2>


<p class="cap"><span class="upper">In</span> the morning-room he found Sir Gregory, who
had refrained, with an impatient delicacy, from
following him further than the drawing-room.
He was walking to and fro before the hearth, another
big cigar between his lips.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo; he asked, as the detective entered.</p>

<p>Gimblet looked at him with a disapproving sternness.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you intend to accompany me further in my
investigations, Sir Gregory,&rdquo; he began, &ldquo;I must warn
you that I can allow no smoking. The sense of smell
is as valuable to me in my work as it is to a questing
hound, and I cannot have red herrings like your cigars
dragged across the trail I might possibly be following.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My cigars! Red herrings!&rdquo; Sir Gregory stuttered.
&ldquo;This, Mr. Gimblet, is the finest Havana!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No doubt,&rdquo; said Gimblet, &ldquo;as tobacco it is good
enough. But if it came straight from Paradise I could
not let the strong smell of it interfere with my business.
I must keep my nose free from such gross odours, or it
will not serve me when I most need it. When we first
came into this room it was filled with a perfume all its
own. Now that I return I can smell nothing but the
taint of your cigar.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Though considerably incensed at Gimblet&rsquo;s choice of
words&mdash;Sir Gregory nearly choked when he heard
them&mdash;he controlled his feelings of indignation as best
he could, for he was bent on seeing the detective at
work. &ldquo;If the flavour of the best tobacco really<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
impedes you,&rdquo; said he, swallowing his annoyance, &ldquo;I
will defer the pleasure of smoking until you have
arrived at some conclusion. I suppose you have not
discovered anything of importance so far?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think I have added to my knowledge by this
visit,&rdquo; returned Gimblet, &ldquo;whether importantly or
not it is too soon to say. You did not mention to me,
by the way, that Miss Turner had inherited her father&rsquo;s
partiality for horses.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t I? I didn&rsquo;t know it would interest you.
Yes; she seems very devoted to riding.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And to racing,&rdquo; added Gimblet.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know about that. She&rsquo;s never been near
a race-course, as far as I know. What makes you
think so? Have you been talking to Blake about
her?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;When a young lady&rsquo;s room is full of pictures of
race-horses, and &lsquo;Ruff&rsquo;s Guide to the Turf&rsquo; occupies a
prominent position on her bookshelf,&rdquo; said Gimblet
indifferently, &ldquo;it is not really necessary to ask the
servants whether she takes an interest in racing. But
come, Sir Gregory, I think we have no more to do here.
Shall we go back to my flat and see if anything has
been heard at the hospitals?&rdquo;</p>

<p>With a farewell word to Blake they prepared to
leave the house, the butler hastening before them to
open the hall door. As he drew back the latch and
they stepped forth into the street, they were confronted
by a grey-haired man carrying a small black bag, who
stood with a hand already upon the bell.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Whom have we here?&rdquo; said the detective to
himself, and taking Sir Gregory&rsquo;s arm he drew him
back into the house, leaving Blake to parley with the
new-comer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, sir, Mrs. Vanderstein&rsquo;s not at home,&rdquo; they
could hear him saying.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span></p>

<p>The two men retreated to the morning-room but
here in a few minutes Blake followed them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you please, sirs,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;here is Mr. Chark,
Mrs. Vanderstein&rsquo;s solicitor.&rdquo;</p>

<p>On his heels came the stranger.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You will excuse me coming to see you, gentlemen,&rdquo;
said he, fixing his eyes, after a momentary hesitation,
upon the detective, &ldquo;but hearing that Mr. Gimblet
was in the house&rdquo;&mdash;here he bowed to that gentleman&mdash;&ldquo;I
thought I had better seize the opportunity of
offering such help as I may be able to furnish in your
investigations. Very little, I fear, still possibly I am
in possession of a fact which may as yet be unknown to
you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Chark, partner in the firm of D&rsquo;Allby and
Chark, was a man of medium height, of medium age,
less than medium good looks, and medium intellect.
His face and hair were of different shades of grey and,
although clean-shaven, he conveyed the impression
that he wore side whiskers. His manner and movements
were precise and deliberate. He spoke slowly,
and as he did so his hands slowly revolved round each
other. It seemed as if he were grinding out each word
by some secret mill-like process differing from that of
ordinary speech.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have just heard from the butler,&rdquo; he continued,
after Gimblet and Sir Gregory had acknowledged his
greeting in suitable terms, &ldquo;that my client, Mrs.
Vanderstein, is absent under circumstances I must be
permitted to designate as unusual. That, in short,
she went out last night, &lsquo;on gaiety intent,&rsquo; he he!
and has not since been heard of. This is very startling
news, very strange news indeed. I think I can prove
to you, Mr. Gimblet, that Mrs. Vanderstein&rsquo;s continued
absence is unintentional.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So saying Mr. Chark unlocked his black bag, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
he had placed on the floor between his feet as if fearing
that it might be surreptitiously removed if he did not
keep in touch with it, and drew from its dark recesses
a letter in a large mauve coloured envelope, which he
handed with another bow to Mr. Gimblet.</p>

<p>The detective took it and lifted it to his nose with a
look of surprise.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;is a letter from Mrs. Vanderstein
herself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your surmise is correct,&rdquo; said Mr. Chark. &ldquo;I was
unaware that you and my client were acquainted, but
I see that you know her handwriting.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I never saw it before,&rdquo; Gimblet answered absently.
He was studying it now with a look of deep interest.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Indeed. Then, may I inquire your reason for
thinking that this document bore her inscription?&rdquo;
Mr. Chark&rsquo;s drawling tones were plainly sceptical.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Arome de la Corse,&rdquo; murmured Gimblet, as he
handed the letter to Sir Gregory. &ldquo;You, Sir Gregory,
know the lady&rsquo;s writing, I suppose?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Sir Gregory. &ldquo;It is from her. Will
you not read it aloud? Without spectacles, I&rsquo;m sorry
to say, I should find a difficulty in doing so,&rdquo; and he
gave it back to Gimblet.</p>

<p>The detective opened the envelope and unfolding
the sheet it contained read aloud what was written on
it:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="right">
<span class="sp1">&ldquo;Grosvenor Street:</span><br />
&ldquo;Monday Evening.
</p>

<p class="noi">
&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Dear Sirs</span>,
</p>

<p class="in3">&ldquo;I shall be much obliged if one of your firm
will call on me to-morrow, Tuesday, between four
and five o&rsquo;clock, for the purpose of altering my will.
Mr. Sidney has made it impossible for me to contemplate
longer the thought of his inheriting any portion
of my late husband&rsquo;s fortune. If Mr. Vanderstein were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
alive I am sure he would agree with me on this point,
but as he is no more and has left the matter to my
discretion, it becomes a sacred duty with me utterly
to ignore the wishes he expressed, and to alter my will
immediately to that effect. Trusting you will make
it convenient to call at teatime to-morrow,</p>

<p class="right">
<span class="sp8">&ldquo;I remain,</span><br />
<span class="sp4">&ldquo;Yours faithfully,</span><br />
&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Ruth Vanderstein</span>.&rdquo;
</p>
</div>

<p>Gimblet folded the letter carefully, replaced it in
the envelope, and handed it back to Mr. Chark.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We heard something of a quarrel between Mrs.
Vanderstein and Mr. Sidney,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I wonder
whether she would have stuck to her threat of cutting
him off with a penny. People write this sort of letter
when they lose their tempers, but very often they
have calmed down by the following day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You do not know Mrs. Vanderstein, Mr. Gimblet,&rdquo;
interrupted Sir Gregory. &ldquo;She isn&rsquo;t one of those
women who fly into a rage about nothing at all, or try
to frighten people with threats. She does not suffer
from nerves; her health is as excellent as her temper.
I am persuaded she wouldn&rsquo;t have written that letter
unless she had the gravest reasons for doing so.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That also is my view,&rdquo; agreed Mr. Chark. &ldquo;I can
endorse Sir Gregory Aberhyn Jones&rsquo;s opinion as regards
the character of my client, Mr. Gimblet; I can endorse
it thoroughly. Mrs. Vanderstein is a level-headed,
shrewd woman, far from being driven by every impulse.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is something decidedly womanly about the
way she considers it her sacred duty to ignore her
husband&rsquo;s wishes,&rdquo; commented Gimblet, and then, as
he saw the wrathful light flashing in Sir Gregory&rsquo;s eyes,
he added quickly, &ldquo;I hope that Mrs. Vanderstein
herself will be able to make everything clear in a few<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
hours&rsquo; time at the most. Sir Gregory and I, Mr.
Chark, were on our way to see if she had been heard
of at the hospitals, at the moment of your arrival. We
fear she may have met with some misadventure.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Chark was disappointed. Beneath his stiff,
outer shell there lurked a tiny spark of romantic fire,
which had never been entirely extinguished by the
stifling routine of the legal casuistries with which
D&rsquo;Allby and Chark principally occupied themselves.
Mortgages, settlements of property, the continual
framing in a maze of words of those deeds which should
mystify any but creatures like himself, to whom their
lack of intelligibility meant profitable business; all
this systematic dullness had failed to choke that
imperceptible glimmer, and at the mere knowledge of
Gimblet&rsquo;s presence in the house it had leapt on a
sudden to a hot and burning flame. All his life he had
cherished a secret regret that his way had not lain
along the precipitous bypaths of criminal law, and now
his excited imagination saw murder and violence
beckoning from all sides, with fingers redly fascinating.
He gave a stiff bow at the detective&rsquo;s words, and spoke
with a feeling of irritation and a sensation of being
played with, which he was careful to conceal beneath
his usual precise and colourless tones.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Indeed,&rdquo; he drawled, his hands revolving as ever
in their stroking movement. &ldquo;I may venture to say
that my impression is a different one. Though no
detective, I am still, in my capacity of lawyer, able to
put two and two together. This letter&rdquo;&mdash;he tapped
Mrs. Vanderstein&rsquo;s note&mdash;&ldquo;and the evidence of the
butler that a quarrel between my client and her nephew
did occur yesterday afternoon in this house, and
immediately preceded the writing of this letter; the
knowledge that the lady left her home intending to
return in two or three hours, but has actually failed to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
do so in twenty&mdash;these facts, gentlemen, if they
convey nothing to you, appear to me to be eminently
suggestive.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Gimblet made no reply; but Sir Gregory, whose
face had been getting pinker and pinker till it resembled
a full-blown peony, burst out with a truculent snort:</p>

<p>&ldquo;And what do they suggest to you, sir?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They suggest,&rdquo; Mr. Chark resumed with apparent
calm, &ldquo;that Mr. Joseph Sidney could very probably
inform us of his aunt&rsquo;s whereabouts.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have the pleasure of Mr. Sidney&rsquo;s acquaintance,&rdquo;
exclaimed Sir Gregory, &ldquo;and let me inform you, Mr.
Chark, if that is your name, that he is a gentleman
holding a commission in His Majesty&rsquo;s army. I hope
it is unnecessary to say more. Your insinuations are
absurd.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You cannot deny in the face of the facts that
matters look very black against this young gentleman,&rdquo;
drawled the lawyer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Black!&rdquo; Sir Gregory seemed about to choke. &ldquo;I
consider it black behaviour, sir, to come here and
make these libellous and scandalous assertions about
an officer and a gentleman. One who, moreover, is,
as I gather, entirely unknown to you. Do you know
him, sir, or do you not?&rdquo; demanded Sir Gregory,
leaning forward and rapping out an accompaniment
to the words with the palm of his hand on a small table
which stood near him, so that the flower glasses on it
danced and jingled.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do not know him, it is true,&rdquo; admitted Mr.
Chark, &ldquo;but I do know that he would benefit to the
extent of several hundred thousands of pounds, if Mrs.
Vanderstein should die before she found it possible to
revise her will. And I have no doubt that she told
him her intention of altering it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Die? What do you say?&rdquo; Sir Gregory&rsquo;s voice<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
came faintly. The rosy colour faded from his cheeks.
The utmost horror and astonishment were depicted in
his countenance.</p>

<p>Gimblet, at the sight, got up from his chair.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Chark,&rdquo; he said severely, &ldquo;you are letting
your imagination run away with you. You are,
indeed, talking like a halfpenny feuilleton. There is
no reason to take so melodramatic a view while Mrs.
Vanderstein&rsquo;s absence still admits of some more or less
ordinary explanation. I am going now to ascertain if
she has not been discovered in the accident ward of
one of the hospitals. Are you coming, Sir Gregory?&rdquo;</p>

<p>With a word of farewell they left the house, cutting
short more observations on the part of Mr. Chark, who
followed them, deeply chagrined at being treated with
such scant ceremony.</p>

<p>Sir Gregory, as he drove with Gimblet in the direction
of Whitehall, returned nervously to the implication of
foul play.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What made him think of such a thing, d&rsquo;ye think?&rdquo;
he asked. &ldquo;It is impossible that young Sidney would
harm her. A nice civil lad; I have always liked him.
Why should he? I&rsquo;ll not believe it.&rdquo; He spoke
disjointedly; the suggestion had shaken him.</p>

<p>Gimblet did his best to reassure him, but when they
reached his flat, and found that the hospitals had been
drawn blank for news of the two ladies, he felt more
concerned than he liked to show. Still, the order that
had been given to the chauffeur, not to return to the
opera house, seemed to point to some intention other
than that of going back to Grosvenor Street, and it was
still to be hoped that any moment might bring tidings.
There were, however, other considerations not quite so
encouraging.</p>

<p>Gimblet, who had left Sir Gregory below while he
ran up to his rooms, gave some instructions to Higgs,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
the man who at times combined the duties of servant
with those of an assistant in the more tiresome but
necessary details of the detective&rsquo;s work. Then he
went down again to break to the baronet, with reluctant
gravity, that there was no news.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We will go to Covent Garden now,&rdquo; he said; and
they got into another taxi.</p>

<p>Sir Gregory had become very silent. His face was
drawn with anxiety. &ldquo;What can have happened?&rdquo;
he kept muttering to himself.</p>

<p>To divert his thoughts, Gimblet recalled the suspicion
he had harboured at first&mdash;that Mrs. Vanderstein had
flown with some other admirer. But the fear that she
was in danger, or that worse had befallen her, had
taken hold of the man, and it was he who now pooh-poohed
the idea and found arguments to show its
improbability.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She had no need to run away,&rdquo; he objected in his
turn, &ldquo;she could marry whom she liked. And whoever
heard of a woman&rsquo;s taking a friend on a wedding trip?
No, if it had been anything of the sort, Miss Turner
would have been left behind, we may be sure of that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At Covent Garden they learnt very little. The box
had been cleaned out, and bore no sign of having been
used the night before. Gimblet went sniffing round it,
but could find no trace of lingering Arome de la Corse.
The box opener told them that Mrs. Vanderstein and
the young lady who generally came with her had
occupied it at the gala performance, and had left before
the end of the last scene. She hadn&rsquo;t noticed anything
strange or otherwise about either of them, and as far
as she knew no one had visited the box during the
intervals.</p>

<p>No one, it appeared, had observed their departure
from the doors of the theatre. One commissionaire
thought he remembered two ladies coming out early<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
and driving off in a carriage, but he couldn&rsquo;t say, he
was sure, what they were like. Might have been young
and lovely, or again, might have been old and ugly.
He had seen a powerful lot of ladies in the course of the
evening, and never had enjoyed what you might call a
memory for faces. If it had not been for the lack
of that useful talent, the commissionaire concluded
regretfully, he would, as likely as not, have been sitting
in the hall of a West End club at the present moment,
with no more to do than to answer the inquiries of one
gentleman for another gentleman. Never had been
what you might call the victim of good luck.</p>

<p>They left him testing a shilling doubtfully with his
teeth, as if unwilling to believe that his fortune could
have changed sufficiently for the coin to be other than
a bad one.</p>

<p>It was growing late, the doors of the theatres would
soon be open. Already shutters were up in front of
shop windows, and the crowds that still filled the streets
had no excuse for loitering now there was nothing to
look at, nowhere left for noses to be flattened. Instead,
every one seemed to be hurrying in one direction, the
direction of railway station or tram, or whatever would
carry them to their homes. The sinking sun had at
last left the streets full of shadows and, though the
pavements and walls still radiated heat, a cool breeze
had arisen and was rushing in from the river. In
open spaces, where the tall walls of houses did not
prevent a glimpse of the western sky, one could see a
cloud or two slowly climbing the heavens.</p>

<p>The two men walked together in silence for a little
way, and then Gimblet stopped, holding out his hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think we can do any more to-night,&rdquo; he
said. &ldquo;Put away your anxieties for a few hours, Sir
Gregory; it does no good to worry. To-morrow, if
fresh tidings come, we must see what else can be done.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
I think perhaps you will be wise to consult the
police.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But at this Sir Gregory raised an outcry.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, we will see about that when to-morrow
comes,&rdquo; said Gimblet. &ldquo;In the meantime I must say
good night.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Gimblet saw Sir Gregory off in the direction of his
club, and then, after a moment&rsquo;s hesitation, hailed a
taxi himself, and drove to the residence of the Postmaster-General.
He thought that at this hour he had
a good chance of finding that Minister at home, and he
was not mistaken.</p>

<p>Sir James was in, said the footman who answered his
ring, but at the present moment engaged in dressing,
before dining early and going to the theatre. He would
take up Mr. Gimblet&rsquo;s card.</p>

<p>As luck had it, it had been Gimblet&rsquo;s fortune to
render a considerable service to Sir James Mossing,
at a date in this gentleman&rsquo;s career when his foot was
still insecurely placed on the first rung of the ladder he
subsequently climbed; and, as he rose in power, the
politician had never failed to show that he gratefully
remembered the obligation. The detective had only
to wait ten minutes before the man he had come to see
hurried into the room, with apologies for keeping him
waiting. Gimblet lost no time in explaining the object
of his visit, and had little difficulty in obtaining the
written order he wished for. Armed with this, he
detained the affable statesman no longer, but withdrew
quickly and turned his steps homeward.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Higgs,&rdquo; he said, as his servant met him in the hall
of the flat. &ldquo;I want you to go at once to the post
office in Piccadilly and get a telegram which was handed
in last evening by a footman. It was in a sealed
envelope, which also held the money for the message.
It may, or may not, be signed by Miss Barbara Turner.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
It was certainly written by her. Here is an order from
the Postmaster-General, which will make things easy
for you. I have one or two things to do that ought to
have been finished this morning or I should go myself.
They will take me about an hour, and I hope you will
be back by that time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In an hour Higgs was back. He looked pleased with
himself, and proffered the detective a sheet of paper.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right, Higgs, you&rsquo;ve been quick,&rdquo; Gimblet
commended him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They were a little while looking through the forms,&rdquo;
said Higgs, &ldquo;but luckily there was no fuss about
giving it to me after I&rsquo;d shown your card and Sir
James&rsquo; order.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Gimblet was reading the paper. It was a telegraph
form addressed to Joseph Sidney, and contained a
short message:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>&ldquo;Luck is coming your way at last expect to have
good news by Wednesday removing all difficulties.&rdquo;</p></div>

<p class="noi">There was no signature.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How do you know this is the right one?&rdquo; Gimblet
asked sharply.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The young person at the office happened to
remember it, sir. It was handed in, enclosed in an
envelope, and when she opened it and saw there was
no signature she ran out after the footman, intending
to ask that the space at the back of the form, where
the name and address is requested for reference only,
should be filled in. She was only in time to see the
motor drive away. Still, it stamped the message on
her memory, especially as there was some change to
give back.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She may easily be mistaken,&rdquo; grumbled the
detective.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I thought you might not be satisfied, sir,&rdquo; said
Higgs, &ldquo;so I went on to Grosvenor Street and asked
the butler to let me have a specimen of Miss Turner&rsquo;s
writing. I didn&rsquo;t tell him why I wanted it, of course.
I just let him think a letter had been found and that
you wanted something to identify it by,&rdquo; added Higgs,
with some pride. He produced a menu as he spoke,
written in a large round hand. &ldquo;Miss Turner always
writes the menus in Grosvenor Street,&rdquo; he explained.</p>

<p>Gimblet took it and compared it with the telegram.
It was easy to see that both had been written by the
same person.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XII" id="CHAPTER_XII">CHAPTER XII</a></h2>


<p class="cap"><span class="upper">The</span> next morning dawned grey and boisterous.
The English climate was giving an example
of that infinite variety to which custom
never reconciles the stranger within our gates. Julie
Querterot, whose life had been passed entirely in
London, suffered from an hereditary sensitiveness to
the changes of the weather, and was never able to
prevent her spirits from drooping as the barometer
fell. Rain and gloomy skies made her dismal even
when her whole day was spent within doors, and on
this Wednesday morning, when she had done with
the business of sweeping and cleaning about the house,
and took up her station in the little shop behind the
hair-pins and pomades, the view from the window must
have had more than its usual depressing effects upon
her, for if the unlooked for had happened and a
customer had chanced to enter he might have seen
that her eyelids were swollen as by the shedding of
many tears.</p>

<p>Soon after midnight the storm that had been brewing
had burst over the empty streets; for hours the
lightning had torn the clouds and the tremendous
noise of the thunder had made sleep impossible. All
night torrents of rain had fallen, and people lying awake,
or at best dozing uneasily, had heard its constant
patter. Julie&rsquo;s face, white and weary, looked as if to
her at least the night had brought no rest. Sitting in
the half-dusk of the shop she took up her work with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
slow deliberation; then letting it fall back to her knee
leant her chin upon her palm with a hopeless gesture.
She had had no breakfast, and hunger was combining
with fatigue to bring her to the point of exhaustion.
By her, on the counter where she had put it down, a
halfpenny paper lay spread out; and presently she
took it up, and glanced again at the prominent headlines,
which in large black type flaunted across the page.</p>

<p class="hd1">&ldquo;DISAPPEARANCE OF LADIES FROM THEIR<br />
HOME IN WEST END.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="hd2">&ldquo;Mystery of Missing Millionairess.&rdquo;</p>

<p>After a while Julie rose and put away her needlework.
Going up to her little bedroom, she took from
the cupboard a small black hat, and regardless of the
weather prepared to go out. Not that she made an
elaborate toilette. A neat coat of plainest black was
added to her blouse and skirt, a rather tawdry brooch
pinned where a button had been torn off, and another,
for pure ornament, in a place where it was not needed.
It has already been said that Julie was fond of trinkets,
and she seemed to derive some slight comfort from them
even this morning. Two or three bracelets jingled
already on either wrist, and when she had added a pair
of gloves her attire was complete. A few minutes
later the girl opened her umbrella and stepped into the
street; then, locking the shop door behind her, she set
her face westward. The rain was falling less heavily,
and before she had taken many turnings it ceased
altogether. Julie shut her umbrella with a sigh of
relief. Since leaving the house she had not been able
to put aside a minor, but still consuming, anxiety, as
to the fate of her hat.</p>

<p class="tb">. . . . .</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span></p>

<p>In his rooms in Whitehall, Gimblet was studying a
copy of the same newspaper that lay now neglected in
the Pimlico shop. One glance at the headlines had
told him to whom they referred, and the paragraph
that followed was still more explicit.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>&ldquo;We learn that anxiety is felt as to the whereabouts
of Mrs. Vanderstein, a lady residing at No.&nbsp;90, Grosvenor
Street, W. Mrs. Vanderstein left her house on the
evening of Monday last for the purpose of attending the
gala performance at the Royal opera house at Covent
Garden. She was accompanied by a young lady, Miss
Barbara Turner, who lives at Grosvenor Street in the
capacity of friend and companion to Mrs. Vanderstein.
The two ladies drove to the opera in their private
motor car, and some surprise was felt by the servants
on being told at the door of the theatre that their
return after the performance was over was not desired.
No alarm, however, was experienced until yesterday
morning, when the household awoke to find that
neither of the ladies had returned.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Inquiry at the hospitals, where it was thought the
ladies might have been carried in the event of an accident
having occurred, were productive of no result, and
as the day passed without news of their whereabouts
being obtained it was deemed advisable to secure the
services of a detective. It is whispered that one of
London&rsquo;s most celebrated criminal investigators has
consented to look into the matter. Rumours reach us
that differences between Mrs. Vanderstein and one of
her nearest relatives have more to do with her disappearance
than at first seems obvious. Mrs. Vanderstein
is the widow of the late Mr. Moses Vanderstein,
a financier well known in city circles. She is a lady
of remarkable personal attractions, and is a great
favourite in Jewish society. Miss Turner is the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
daughter of the late Mr. William Turner, of Newmarket,
and is not much over twenty years of age. It is
believed that the police have a clue to the continued
absence of the two ladies, and that foul play is
apprehended.&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<p>&ldquo;So,&rdquo; said Gimblet to himself, &ldquo;it appears that the
worthy Mr. Chark has been talking.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As he threw aside the paper, and took up another to
see if it also had something to say on the same subject,
the bell of the flat rang, and a moment later Higgs
announced Mr. Joseph Sidney.</p>

<p>With a scarcely perceptible start Gimblet recognised
the young man he had observed in the Park on Sunday.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hope I don&rsquo;t disturb you,&rdquo; Sidney said at once,
&ldquo;but they told me in Grosvenor Street that you had
been up there asking questions, and so I suppose Sir
Gregory has engaged you to look into this business.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is so,&rdquo; said Gimblet. &ldquo;I hope you have
come to give me some assistance.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, I wish to goodness I could,&rdquo; said Sidney,
&ldquo;but I never heard a word about it till I saw the paper
this morning; and then I couldn&rsquo;t believe it. But I
rang up Grosvenor Street pretty quick, and old Blake,
my aunt&rsquo;s butler, swears it&rsquo;s gospel. It&rsquo;s a queer
thing to happen, isn&rsquo;t it? What can they have done
with themselves? Really, women ought not to be
allowed out alone. If my aunt couldn&rsquo;t take care of
herself, I do think she might have made an effort to
look after Miss Turner!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a queer business indeed,&rdquo; said Gimblet, &ldquo;and
I&rsquo;m afraid it looks stranger every minute, and very
much more serious than it did at first. For here&rsquo;s
another night gone by and no news of either of the
ladies. And we have no clue, no idea where to hunt,
nor anything whatever to go on in our search. I was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
in hopes you might have some information to offer me,
Mr. Sidney; you were, I believe, one of the last people
who spoke with Mrs. Vanderstein on Monday.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Gimblet looked narrowly at the young man, who, for
his part, seemed not altogether at his ease. He
hesitated, crossed to the window and drummed with
his fingers on the pane. In the detective&rsquo;s ears was
echoing a sentence heard above the murmur of the
crowd: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m pretty desperate, I can tell you. There&rsquo;s
nothing I wouldn&rsquo;t do to get the money.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A second later Sidney turned; and, coming back to
where Gimblet sat impassively waiting, drew up a
chair upon which he sat himself down with an air of
resolution.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I did see my aunt on Monday, Mr. Gimblet, and to
tell you the truth I don&rsquo;t like telling you what she said
to me then. One doesn&rsquo;t care about confiding one&rsquo;s
private family affairs to strangers. Still, if you think it
can be of any possible use.... Well, the fact is that I
had a frightful row with Mrs. Vanderstein on Monday.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What about?&rdquo; asked Gimblet.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I,&rdquo; Sidney hesitated again, and then continued
with a plunge, &ldquo;I have been losing a great deal of
money lately; I am ashamed to say that I have lost
it on race-courses, and that it is a sum far larger than I
can afford. I went to my aunt to ask for help. I asked
her, in fact, to lend me some money to tide over my
difficulties for the present. She was very irate about
it. She can&rsquo;t stand betting; and as soon as I told her
she got in a fearful rage and threw me out of the house.
That is all the conversation I had with her on Monday.
You can understand I don&rsquo;t much like owning up to it,
as it&rsquo;s not precisely to my credit.&rdquo; Sidney ended with
a rueful laugh.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Vanderstein absolutely refused to help you
in any way?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Said she&rsquo;d see me damned first. Well, you know,
she mayn&rsquo;t have put it exactly like that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hardly, I should think. I&rsquo;d rather have her own
words, if you can remember them, please.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sidney searched his memory. &ldquo;As far as I can
recollect, what she actually said was, &lsquo;I will have
nothing whatever to do with a gambler like you. Not
only will I not give you money now, but you shall
never have a penny that is mine to use for that degrading
vice. I shall alter my will,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;and that
to-morrow. And never let me see you again. I&rsquo;ll not
have you in my house.&rsquo; That&rsquo;s what she said, and I
had nothing to do but to go out of the house like a
whipped dog. And I went.&rdquo; Sidney&rsquo;s voice was
bitter as he recalled his humiliation, but when he spoke
again he had recovered his normal good temper.
&ldquo;Poor Aunt Ruth,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s a good deal to
be said on her side, you know, and just about nothing
at all on mine. However, I didn&rsquo;t come to talk about
my own rotten affairs. I wonder where she can have
got to? There&rsquo;s something uncommon fishy about her
vanishing this way, don&rsquo;t you think? Hope to goodness
she&rsquo;s not been knocked on the head for the sake of
her diamonds, you know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>His tone was light, but Gimblet seemed to perceive
a note of genuine anxiety underlying it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hope not, indeed,&rdquo; he agreed gravely.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I really feel a bit worried about her&mdash;her and Miss
Turner,&rdquo; went on the young man. &ldquo;Hang it all, since
I&rsquo;ve begun confiding in you I think I may as well make
a clean breast of the whole show. The fact is I&rsquo;ve got
a beastly guilty conscience sort of feeling, because I
was on the verge, a day or two ago, of playing the
dickens of a shabby trick on Aunt Ruth. You can see
how badly I want this money, as I told you, to pay my
debts next week. Well, I as near as makes no difference<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
tried to get it out of my aunt by what I suppose you&rsquo;d
call false pretences&mdash;which sounds a nice blackguardly
thing to do, don&rsquo;t it? I don&rsquo;t suppose anyone&rsquo;s told
you that she had a craze for Royalty in any shape?
Well, I didn&rsquo;t know it myself till lately, but it seems
there&rsquo;s nothing she wouldn&rsquo;t do to get in contact with
great people. A friend of mine suggested that we
should get another of my pals to impersonate some
royal prince, and that I should introduce him to my
aunt. The idea was that he should rather make up to
her, and then intercede on my behalf, or get the money
out of her in some way. I don&rsquo;t think I should have
done it when it came to the point, because I saw very
plainly the next day what an impossible thing it was
to do. And if I&rsquo;d gone as far as to ask my friend to
help, I haven&rsquo;t the slightest doubt he would have told
me not to be an ass. But there you are&mdash;I did think
of it, and it sticks on my conscience now. I shall
never get the taste out of my mouth, I believe, and if
there&rsquo;s anything you think I could do to be of any use,
now that she&rsquo;s gone and mislaid herself, you can
understand that I&rsquo;d do it all the more gladly since I
feel I owe her a good turn.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He ceased speaking, crossed one leg over the other,
and leant back, looking at Gimblet with an air half
ashamed, half ingenuous.</p>

<p>The detective returned his gaze with interest.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here,&rdquo; he was saying to himself, &ldquo;is a young man
either very innocent or beyond the common crafty.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who was it who suggested this questionable
proceeding in the first place?&rdquo; he asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I really can&rsquo;t tell you that,&rdquo; cried Sidney;
&ldquo;it can&rsquo;t have any importance, and I&rsquo;m not so dead
to all sense of decency as you naturally think!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You say you only contemplated it for a short
time. Did you tell your friend ultimately that, on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
second thoughts, you didn&rsquo;t like the idea and had
decided to give it up?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t necessary. Before I could communicate
with my friend I got a message from her&mdash;him&mdash;my
friend, I mean&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; Sidney grew scarlet as he realised
his slip, but continued hastily in the vain hope of
covering it, &ldquo;a message to say that the plan was
ruined. I don&rsquo;t know what had happened, but for
some reason, apparently, it was completely off,
irrespective of my jibbing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And so now,&rdquo; said Gimblet, after a pause, &ldquo;you
have no hope, I suppose, of paying your debts.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A shade crossed Sidney&rsquo;s face as he replied sadly:
&ldquo;Devil a hope.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There has been no alteration in your prospects
since Monday then,&rdquo; pursued the detective; &ldquo;you have
had no better news to-day? Your difficulties have
not so far been removed?&rdquo; He spoke with great
deliberation, while one hand, hidden in his pocket,
fingered the telegraph form that Barbara Turner had
omitted to sign.</p>

<p>Sidney looked up suspiciously, but the little man&rsquo;s
face wore no expression beyond one of calm inquiry.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said he slowly, &ldquo;everything is just as it was.
I have heard nothing at all and my prospects are as
bad as they can be.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was something about Sidney that disarmed
suspicion, and Gimblet did not fail to be influenced by
it. In vain he reflected that the young man was
certainly refraining from telling him of Miss Turner&rsquo;s
telegram, and deliberately, since Gimblet had purposely
reminded him of it by quoting words it actually contained.
As he sat considering what should be his next
move, the door opened, and Sir Gregory Aberhyn
Jones was announced.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good morning, Mr. Gimblet. Have you any news<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
for me? No, I see you have not; and there is none
in Grosvenor Street, as you doubtless know. Ah,
Sidney, how are you? This is a trying time for us all.
I am glad to see you, very.&rdquo; He shook hands warmly
with the young man; and then, before Gimblet
guessed what he would be at, the harm was done.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m more than glad to meet you, my dear boy,&rdquo; Sir
Gregory was declaring, &ldquo;so as to be able to tell you
that I don&rsquo;t believe a word they may say against you.
I&rsquo;m positive you never had a hand in this black
business, any more than I did myself. And all the
Charks and beastly rags of newspapers in London
shan&rsquo;t convince me to the contrary.&rdquo; Sir Gregory,
still holding Joe by the hand, shook it up and down
with extra and exaggerated heartiness.</p>

<p>Sidney wrenched it away.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What the deuce are you talking about?&rdquo; he
exclaimed. &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s been saying things about me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I tell you I don&rsquo;t believe a word of it,&rdquo; said Sir
Gregory soothingly. &ldquo;But you must have seen it in
the papers. &lsquo;It is believed,&rsquo; they say, &lsquo;that a quarrel
took place between Mrs. Vanderstein and a near
relative, which has more to do with the unfortunate
ladies&rsquo; disappearance than seems plain at first.&rsquo; You
did quarrel with her, didn&rsquo;t you? And Chark, her
lawyer, you know, is taken with the idea; in fact, he&rsquo;s
been round telling me this morning that he&rsquo;s ascertained
for a fact that you&rsquo;re infernally hard up, which would
provide a motive, he says. Infernal nonsense, of
course.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Infernal lies,&rdquo; cried Sidney; &ldquo;what the devil does
anyone mean by suggesting such things? Do they
imagine I&rsquo;ve spirited away not only Aunt Ruth but
Miss Turner too, and am holding them for ransom,
or what? Or perhaps your friend Chark would rather
think that I was given to poisoning my relations? If<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
it comes to that, I&rsquo;ll begin on him if he don&rsquo;t look out.
Infernal ass.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He was furious. Gimblet, watching him with
interest, wondered whether his face was so red from
anger or from some other emotion.</p>

<p>Sir Gregory, for once, was silenced.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s this newspaper editor?&rdquo; demanded
Sidney. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to kick him, now, at once.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d better wait till he gets up,&rdquo; said Gimblet;
&ldquo;at this hour he&rsquo;s probably still in bed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll soon get him out.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Better not take any notice of it. More dignified
not to,&rdquo; urged Sir Gregory, repenting too late his
well-meant assurances. &ldquo;Best treat that sort of idiot
with contempt,&rdquo; he went on. &ldquo;Chark&rsquo;s the worst.
It&rsquo;s he that&rsquo;s put them up to it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Chark,&rdquo; said Gimblet, &ldquo;has a longing to be
mixed up in a sensational affair. I saw that yesterday.
He ought to know better than to indulge in libel, a
lawyer too! I daresay he&rsquo;s frightened to death, now
that he has done it, and has time to think of the
consequences.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll frighten him,&rdquo; said the young man.</p>

<p>He calmed down, however, as the detective continued
to pour oil on the troubled waters, and was at
last persuaded to depart peacefully.</p>

<p>Gimblet wrote out a short description of the missing
ladies, together with the promise of a reward to whosoever
should bring news of either of them, and this he
gave into Sidney&rsquo;s keeping, charging him to have it
inserted in the evening papers, of which the early
editions were already appearing in the streets.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIII" id="CHAPTER_XIII">CHAPTER XIII</a></h2>


<p class="cap"><span class="upper">Sir Gregory</span> lingered. &ldquo;I suppose there&rsquo;s
nothing to do but wait?&rdquo; he said, as the door
closed behind Sidney.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not much, I&rsquo;m afraid,&rdquo; replied the detective.
&ldquo;Believe me, I am doing what is possible, and now
that Chark has been talking to the press no doubt the
police, on their side, will do what they can. Did you
hear anything in Grosvenor Street?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Sir Gregory, &ldquo;no one had been there.
They had seen no more of Mr. Chark. But no doubt
there will be folks calling to-day. I daresay the street
will be blocked by people wanting to know if what
they&rsquo;ve seen in the papers is true. There&rsquo;s plenty of
curiosity about. It was beginning already, from what
I could see, when I came away; there were three or
four idlers staring at the house. What they thought
they saw in it, don&rsquo;t ask me. Expect the police soon
moved them on. Too much of this lazy loafing about;
I&rsquo;d soon compel them to do some honest work, if I had
my way.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And yet you&rsquo;re against compelling them to be
trained for the defence of the country!&rdquo; murmured
Gimblet. &ldquo;Well, well! Just ordinary loafers, were
they?&rdquo; he went on.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all,&rdquo; said Sir Gregory, after a moment,
during which he glared fiercely at Gimblet.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Except one young woman,&rdquo; he continued, as an
afterthought. &ldquo;Poor thing, she seemed really distressed;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
but more because she thought she&rsquo;d never
see her money than on Mrs. Vanderstein&rsquo;s account.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;One of the maidservants?&rdquo; suggested the detective.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, no, I think not. She came up just as I was
leaving the house. &lsquo;Oh, sir,&rsquo; she cried, &lsquo;can you tell
me if there&rsquo;s any truth in what I&rsquo;ve seen in the papers,
about the lady that lives here having disappeared?
Surely it&rsquo;s not true?&rsquo; She seemed so much concerned
that I explained the state of affairs to her. &lsquo;It is true,&rsquo;
I said, &lsquo;that the ladies of this house went out on
Monday night, and have not yet come back. But I
hope we may find out where they are at any moment.&rsquo;
To my surprise no sooner had I said this than she
leant back against the door-post as if she were going
to faint or something, devilish ill she looked, poor
creature, and then quite suddenly covered her face with
her hands and burst into tears. I must own,&rdquo; Sir
Gregory confessed, &ldquo;that the sight of so much feeling
exhibited on Mrs. Vanderstein&rsquo;s account moved me
considerably. A very little more and I should have
mingled my tears with those of the poor girl. &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t
cry, my dear child,&rsquo; I said, a good deal affected. &lsquo;It
is natural that those who care for her should feel
anxious and upset, but we must show a brave face and
hope for the best.&rsquo; Still, in spite of all I could say, she
went on crying, and sobbed very piteously, poor
thing; till at last, on my asking her how it was that
she was so anxious about Mrs. Vanderstein, she
managed to regain control of herself, and said in a
doleful tone: &lsquo;I&rsquo;m only a poor girl, sir, and the lady
owes us money. If she is lost it means a great deal to
me.&rsquo; I own I was disappointed, having thought her
distress prompted by affection rather than mercenary
considerations; but people are all alike in this world;
self-interest, Mr. Gimblet, that&rsquo;s the only motive that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
rules men&rsquo;s actions nowadays. However, I did my
best to comfort her, and told her that whatever
happened Mrs. Vanderstein&rsquo;s bills would not go unpaid.
I can&rsquo;t say I was very successful in my efforts to reassure
her and she went off in the end looking dreadfully
woe-begone. &rsquo;Pon my word, I never saw such a
miserable, frightened-looking little creature! I didn&rsquo;t
like to let her go without trying to help her in some
way, but I hardly knew what to do, for she didn&rsquo;t look
the sort one could offer money to,&rdquo; concluded Sir
Gregory, who had the kindest heart in the world.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What was she like?&rdquo; asked Gimblet with a show
of interest.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A shop girl, I should say, but she had a foreign look
about her: a lot of dark hair, and big dark eyes to
match, and she was neatly dressed, trim and tidy. You
know the sort of way these French girls get themselves
up, but all in black or some dark colour. Very quiet
and respectable-looking girl. The only thing I thought
looked a bit flashy about her was that she wore a heap
of common jewellery, bracelets and brooches all over,
cheap and nasty; and I could see a string of great
beads round her neck under her blouse, imitation pearls
as big as marbles. I was astonished, I must say, at her
going in for that sort of thing, for in other ways she
seemed a very nice, quiet girl. Looked terribly ill, too,
poor thing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wonder who she was,&rdquo; said Gimblet. &ldquo;Do you
say she wore her necklace under her blouse?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I could see it through the muslin or whatever
it was she had on. Some transparent stuff.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That was rather curious. Girls of that class, who
are fond of decking themselves out with such cheap
ornaments, don&rsquo;t generally hide their finery. It&rsquo;s
generally quite on the surface, I think.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should think it was unusual,&rdquo; agreed Sir Gregory.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
&ldquo;She must have dressed in a hurry, and done it by
mistake; don&rsquo;t you think so?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Gimblet did not answer. He had been wandering
about the room, in an aimless fashion, and now he
paused beside a table and offered Sir Gregory the
contents of a glass jar that stood upon it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have some barley sugar?&rdquo; he suggested. And, as
Sir Gregory indignantly refused: &ldquo;One must have a
pet vice, and after all, this is my only one,&rdquo; said he,
putting a large piece into his mouth. But Sir Gregory
only shook his head mournfully and refused to smile.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suppose,&rdquo; he said after a moment, with a shamefaced
look, &ldquo;that there can&rsquo;t be anything in Chark&rsquo;s
idea, can there?&rdquo; His tone was that of one who
pleads to have a disturbing and discreditable doubt
utterly removed. Gimblet remembered the warmth
of the baronet&rsquo;s protestations to Sidney, and suppressed
a smile.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think we may hope for a solution less shocking
than Mr. Chark&rsquo;s,&rdquo; he said hopefully. &ldquo;As for
whether his suspicions can have anything in them or
not, I can only say that they are nothing much more
than the wildest of surmises. They amount to this.
Mr. Sidney has lost money in a way disapproved of by
Mrs. Vanderstein, and, on appealing to her for assistance,
was met not only by reproaches but by threats
that he would be cut off from his inheritance. On the
other hand, Mrs. Vanderstein is not very much older
than her nephew, so that his expectations of enjoying
that inheritance could never be other than extremely
remote, since the lady enjoys the best of health. Mr.
Chark does not hesitate to hint that Sidney may have
taken his aunt&rsquo;s life, in order that he may at once
inherit the money of which he is certainly in urgent
need. And if he could contemplate such a deed at all
there may be said to be this further inducement, that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
in the event of Mrs. Vanderstein remaining alive she
would most likely marry again; when, if she had
children, she would probably&mdash;since she has full power
over it&mdash;leave most if not all her fortune to them,
whatever her late husband&rsquo;s hopes may have been
regarding the disposal of it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Chark takes these circumstances and finds in them a
motive; he then takes Mrs. Vanderstein&rsquo;s disappearance
and proceeds to infer from that, that young
Sidney has made away with her. His motive may
exist, though it is a question whether such a motive is
strong enough to induce so terrible a crime in a young
man of Sidney&rsquo;s class and upbringing, who is in normal
health, and we will presume, for the sake of argument,
sane. But Chark has not, as far as I know, a
shadow of evidence on which to assert that the lady has
been injured in any way; and I think any such
conjecture is ridiculous without more to support it;
while to suggest it publicly, as he has done, is quite
scandalous. It is still perfectly possible that Mrs.
Vanderstein or Miss Turner received some urgent
message while at the opera, which caused them to
leave before the end of the performance. It may
have been an appeal for help from some friend in
trouble, or something involving a certain secrecy of
procedure. There are thousands of possible situations
that might arise, to the conduct of which privacy would
be essential. Wait, Sir Gregory, at least to see if we
get an answer to our advertisements, before allowing
your imagination to follow headlong in the wake of
Mr. Chark&rsquo;s speculations.&rdquo;</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIV" id="CHAPTER_XIV">CHAPTER XIV</a></h2>


<p class="cap"><span class="upper">Late</span> in the afternoon, Gimblet, returning to
the flat in Whitehall, found a visitor awaiting
him there.</p>

<p>Higgs, hearing his footstep in the hall, hurried out
to meet him and inform him of the fact.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A young lady, sir. She gave me this card, and
wants to see you on business. She&rsquo;s been here about
ten minutes, and I&rsquo;ve taken tea in to her, not knowing
how long you might be, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Gimblet took the card and read: &ldquo;Miss Seraphina
Finner, Inanity Theatre.&rdquo; &ldquo;Where is she?&rdquo; he asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In the waiting-room,&rdquo; replied Higgs; and Gimblet
went at once into the small sitting-room he set apart
to be used by people unknown to him.</p>

<p>As he opened the door Gimblet checked himself for
a moment on the threshold with the sensation of
entering some one else&rsquo;s room by mistake. His visitor
had pushed most of the furniture back against the
wall, and was, when he first caught sight of her, in the
act of pirouetting round in the middle of the floor,
with her skirts lifted high and one foot raised to the
level of the mantelpiece. Her back was towards him,
but at the sound of the opening door she twisted round
with a swinging movement, and confronted him with
a laugh.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They told me you were out,&rdquo; said Miss Finner
gaily, and without any trace of embarrassment, &ldquo;so I
just started doing a bit of practising to fill up the time<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
while the tea is standing. Waste not, want not, that&rsquo;s
my motto,&rdquo; she added.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry to have kept you waiting,&rdquo; the detective
began; &ldquo;won&rsquo;t you sit down now?&rdquo; And he
pulled out a chair she had piled with some others in a
corner, and offered it to her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suppose I may as well,&rdquo; admitted the young
woman; &ldquo;though it does seem a pity not to do a bit
of exercising now I&rsquo;ve cleared the room. You see, I
dance in &lsquo;The Jodeling Girl,&rsquo; and one has to keep
one&rsquo;s limbs supple, or, if you aren&rsquo;t up to the mark one
night, they put on somebody else. Fact is,&rdquo; she added
confidentially, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s why they took me on. Dixie
Topping, who used to be one of the four of us that do
the dance I&rsquo;m in, let herself get stiff, and one night
when it came to kicking William Tell&rsquo;s apple off the
boy&rsquo;s head, she missed it clean, and, as it&rsquo;s got to be
done in time with the music, that put the conductor
out, so when she had another try, and missed it again,
he got so mad that they sacked her and put me on.
Ill wind that blows no one any good,&rdquo; said Miss
Seraphina philosophically.</p>

<p>Her belongings were strewn about the room: a great
bouquet of carnations lay on a chair, gloves and scarf
were thrown on the bookshelf, while an enormous hat
covered with flowers and ribbons was poised on a
cabinet. She had drawn a curtain across the window,
no doubt out of consideration for her complexion, as
Gimblet happened to have chosen for this room
hangings of a becoming rose colour; and the air was
filled with the reek of inexpensive scent. The detective
compared it mentally, and extremely unfavourably,
with the Arome de la Corse. Altogether he would
not have recognised his own room, to such an extent
had ten minutes of Miss Seraphina Finner&rsquo;s occupation
removed all former traces of his own individuality. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
actually started as he suddenly noticed, perched on the
mantelpiece, a pair of small white animals: a smooth-haired
cat with eyes of a greenish yellow, and a dog
no bigger, but with a long, silky coat. It appeared to
be one of the tribe known to the unappreciative as
Fidos, and to the admiring owners as Toy Poms. It
stood at one end of the shelf, fidgeting and whining, but
not daring to jump. The cat had retired to the
extreme opposite corner, where it sat with its paws
very close together and its tail curled tightly round
them, surveying the restless behaviour of the dog with
a look of sleepy disdain. The feelings with which
Gimblet saw these two, but more especially the dog,
sharing this point of vantage with his best blue and
white china may be imagined. He was speechless;
and perhaps it was just as well.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hope you don&rsquo;t mind Nigger and Pompom,&rdquo;
said Miss Finner, as she accepted a cup of tea, &ldquo;lots
of lumps, please, and heaps of cream too. Seraphina&rsquo;s
pets are her inseparable companions! Don&rsquo;t they look
sweet up there? I put them there to be out of the
way while I was on my light fantastic. It bothers me
never to know when my foot will come down on one of
them, instead of the floor. Pompom seems to enjoy
being trampled on by the way he&rsquo;s always in the middle
of the room.&rdquo; She seized the woolly dog by the scruff
of the neck and deposited it in her lap. &ldquo;Was you
frightened of falling on your heady peady, darling,&rdquo; she
murmured, fondling it ecstatically. &ldquo;No, no, you
mustn&rsquo;t lick your auntie&rsquo;s face; might give you a pain
in your little inside. Isn&rsquo;t she a sweet little affectionate
thing?&rdquo; she asked, raising her eyes for a moment to
Gimblet&rsquo;s. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she went on, as the little dog
danced on her knee in a frantic effort to make clear his
need to share the cake she had taken, &ldquo;Pompom shall
have a cake too. His auntie wouldn&rsquo;t let her darling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
go hungry, no, she wouldn&rsquo;t! And Nigger shall have
some cream for a nice treat.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She poured some cream into a saucer and placed it
on the floor at her feet. The cat, which had watched
the attentions showered on Pompom with the cold eye
of indifference, now abandoned its pose of superiority,
and jumping lightly to the ground approached the
saucer on noiseless, unhurried tiptoes. It began to
lap the cream with a genteel, condescending air, and
with due regard for its whiskers, shaking its head
sharply if a drop adhered to one of their long, stiff hairs.</p>

<p>Miss Finner contemplated the sight with admiring
delight.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t it do your heart good to see how he likes
it?&rdquo; she asked, &ldquo;and aren&rsquo;t his manners lovely? Oh,
Pompom, what an example he is to you, darling!&rdquo; she
exclaimed, as Pompom snatched at a piece of cake and
swallowed it with one gulp. &ldquo;Try and behave like
your brother does, my angel. He&rsquo;s always the same,&rdquo;
she went on, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care where you put him, Nigger
is always the perfect gentleman. Why! I took them
across to Paris at Easter. Didn&rsquo;t know what a trouble
I should have smuggling Pompom home again, or I
should have left her behind in London. I tied feathers
all over her, though, and put her in a bonnet box, so
they took her for a hat, the darling. As if any hat
was half as beautiful! But, as I was saying, we had a
beast of a crossing. Oh my! that channel! And poor
Pompom was one of the first to feel it. And much
as I love her, I must say, she just gave way, and
never made the tiniest little effort to hide her feelings.
But Nigger! If you&rsquo;ll believe me, that cat was so
ashamed of the way he felt he was going to behave
that the tears streamed down his face, and he just
mewed and mewed till I could have cried; only being
so sick myself I really didn&rsquo;t care, as a matter of fact.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
But though he felt so bad he didn&rsquo;t forget his manners
and he wouldn&rsquo;t be sick, he simply wouldn&rsquo;t, till I gave
him a basin. Then certainly. Oh Lord!&rdquo; Miss Finner
stopped. The recollection was too much even for her;
she was also slightly out of breath.</p>

<p>Gimblet listened to her with amusement. Though
he wondered vaguely what her business with him could
be, he let her run on, supposing that she would disclose
it in time. After a moment she resumed in serious
tones:</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a good thing, don&rsquo;t you think, to have a fad of
some kind? It&rsquo;s so hard to get noticed, isn&rsquo;t it?
Expect you found that when you started looking for
thieves? People won&rsquo;t see that one&rsquo;s any different
to anyone else, do what you like. But manage to
have something really out of the common about you,
and you get your chance. That&rsquo;s what I think. They
forget me all right, but they remember my white cat
and dog, and after a little they begin to notice me too.
I had a pretty hard time at first, I tell you,&rdquo; Miss
Finner sighed. &ldquo;But I&rsquo;m getting on well now, thanks,&rdquo;
she continued, with a return of her former vivacity.
&ldquo;Of course I haven&rsquo;t got a speaking part yet, but I&rsquo;m
doing a dance, and that&rsquo;s something at the Inanity.
Some one sent me a diamond brooch last week,&rdquo; she
added with pride, pointing to an ugly little diamond
star. &ldquo;What do you think of it? You&rsquo;re a judge of
stones, I should think, being always in the society of
burglars, as one may say.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Gimblet examined and admired. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid,
though, I&rsquo;m not really a judge,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s your modesty. But, as you see, I&rsquo;m
prosperous. And it isn&rsquo;t after the reward that I&rsquo;ve
come. Not that I&rsquo;ll deny that the money would
always be useful. Still, it&rsquo;s the ad. I&rsquo;m thinking about.
Will you put my name in the paper now? &lsquo;Miss<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
Seraphina Finner of the Inanity brings news of the
missing ladies.&rsquo; That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;d like to see, right
across a poster.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A flicker of interest showed itself for an instant on
Gimblet&rsquo;s face. &ldquo;So that&rsquo;s it,&rdquo; he said to himself.</p>

<p>Aloud he answered: &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know whether I can
promise you that just yet. It rather depends, you
know. But if I am called upon to send any communication
on the subject to the press, you may be
sure that, if possible, your name shall be inserted.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Seraphina pouted. &ldquo;I call that stingy,&rdquo; she complained.
&ldquo;He might put us on a poster, Pompom,
mightn&rsquo;t he? He&rsquo;s an unkind, cruel man, he is.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you know of the missing ladies?&rdquo; asked
Gimblet, disregarding these observations.</p>

<p>Miss Finner assumed an air of importance. &ldquo;I
didn&rsquo;t know anything about it till lunchtime,&rdquo; she
said. &ldquo;Not being what you&rsquo;d call an early riser, it&rsquo;s
not often I take a squint at the newspapers unless it&rsquo;s
in the afternoon. But to-day a friend came to see me
and we had lunch together. By and by she begins
talking about one thing and another, and presently
she says: &lsquo;Have you read about these ladies that
have disappeared?&rsquo; So I said no, what was it, and
she said: &lsquo;What! haven&rsquo;t you seen the paper? There&rsquo;s
an exciting bit about them in this morning&rsquo;s <cite>Crier</cite>.&rsquo;
When she&rsquo;d told me all she could remember, I began
to get interested. I had a feeling, you know, as if
this was in my part. So I sent out for a paper, and
they brought in one of the evening editions which had
the reward and description of the ladies in it, as well as
everything, or so my friend said, that the <cite>Crier</cite> had.
I read it all out loud, and when I came to the part
about wearing a white dress with mauve cloak heavily
embroidered and a large amount of valuable jewellery,
I said to myself: &lsquo;This, Seraphina, my dear, is where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
you walk on.&rsquo; By the time I&rsquo;d finished the paragraph
I was certain sure. It was just a fluke,&rdquo; said Miss
Finner reflectively, &ldquo;that I ever saw that description or
heard anything about it at all, for, as I say, I don&rsquo;t
look at the papers more than about once in a fortnight,
unless it&rsquo;s the notices of a new show.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Gimblet&rsquo;s murmured comment might have passed
for astonishment, agreement, or merely encouragement
to proceed. He thought it best to let her tell her story
in her own way.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a funny thing,&rdquo; she went on after a moment&rsquo;s
silence; &ldquo;it seems somehow as if it was meant to be,
doesn&rsquo;t it? Well, the reason why I felt so excited,
when I read the description, was because I had seen
the ladies later than anyone else. I saw them on
Monday night, after they left the opera.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And where did you see them?&rdquo; asked Gimblet,
bending over the cat, which, having finished the
cream, was rubbing itself in a friendly fashion against
his leg, where it left a covering of white hairs on his
dark trousers. &ldquo;Poor pussy,&rdquo; he said, stroking it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was driving home from the theatre in a taxi,&rdquo;
said Seraphina. &ldquo;I live up in Carolina Road, N.W. I
don&rsquo;t suppose you know it; up beyond Regent&rsquo;s Park,
to the right, as you may say, of Maida Vale. It was a
very hot, sultry night, you remember, and I&rsquo;d got the
cab open so as to get a little air. I was tired for some
reason&mdash;it&rsquo;s not often you can tire me&mdash;and I put my
head back, and my feet on one of the back seats, and as
near as possible went off into a snooze. That&rsquo;s why I
can&rsquo;t tell you exactly which street it was in, and I&rsquo;m
afraid that makes it very awkward.&rdquo; Miss Finner&rsquo;s
voice was full of regret.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Suddenly we swung round a corner with such a
bump that it roused me, and I sat up and took notice.
We were driving through a nice wide street, with trees<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
on each side, and good-sized houses set back in little
gardens, all separate from each other. Each garden
had two gates, and just room for a carriage to drive in
and out. There wasn&rsquo;t a light to be seen in one of
them, and I thought how early the people in those
parts went to bye-bye. And then I caught sight of an
open doorway, with the light shining from it out into
the small yard or garden in front, and a street lamp
standing exactly in front of it; so that between the
two the place was well lit up. There was a carriage
just driving out through the gate, and there were no
shrubs or bushes in the garden, nothing but a little
yard it was, I think, so I could see the two ladies
standing in front of the door as plain as the nose on
your face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I turned round when we&rsquo;d passed and stared back
at them, for the street wasn&rsquo;t crowded with people in
gorgeous opera cloaks and blazing with diamonds, like
one of these two was. I suppose it was Mrs. Vanderstein.
She was standing a little to one side, as if she&rsquo;d
taken a step or two after the carriage, and was looking
after it still. She had on a white dress, all sparkling,
and a mauve or pink cloak thrown open and back on
her shoulders, so I could see the jewels flashing and
shining away all over her as right as rain, just like it
says in the papers. There was a tiara on the top of
her head as big as, as&mdash;&rdquo; Seraphina gazed round
searchingly for a simile&mdash;&ldquo;as big as that chandelier.
Oh, it can&rsquo;t have been anyone else! And besides,
there was the other young lady; I didn&rsquo;t look at her so
much, but I can swear she had a red cloak on. There
now! As soon as I read about them I remembered
what I&rsquo;d seen on Monday night, and I said to my friend:
&lsquo;My dear, I&rsquo;m going out to keep an appointment with
my photographer. Ta-ta.&rsquo; I wasn&rsquo;t going to let on to
her, of course. She&rsquo;s a bit of a cat, as a matter of fact.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span></p>

<p>Miss Finner stopped, fixing on Gimblet a gaze full
of modest pride. But Gimblet sat, to all appearance,
lost in thought. Though his eye met hers, it was with
an abstracted look, and this in spite of the fact that
Miss Finner&rsquo;s eyes were blue and darkly fringed. He
could not fail to observe her curls of gold, the pink
transparency of her cheek, the broad green and white
stripes of her silken gown. He could not fail to hear,
whenever she moved, the jingling of bracelets, of the
many charms that were suspended from the chain
around her white throat, and the merry peal of her
laugh; but all this seemed to be escaping his attention,
and Miss Finner could detect nowhere the glances of
admiration, which she considered the least that was
due to her.</p>

<p>Instead, he had nothing but prosaic questions for her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What time do you say this was?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;After the theatre. Nearly midnight. I was late
getting away.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know the name of the street? Could
you find your way to it again?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Afraid not, it&rsquo;s not the way one generally goes.
I&rsquo;ve no idea where it was, beyond what I&rsquo;ve told you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And the house? Did you notice nothing about it
to distinguish it from its neighbours?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, I didn&rsquo;t look at it specially. Yes, I did,
though; there was a board with &lsquo;To Let&rsquo; on it, up on
the railings. The light from the lamp showed it very
clearly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the only thing you can remember?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Seraphina.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You said the door was open. Could you see
anything of the inside of the house?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, or at least I didn&rsquo;t notice anything. There
might have been some one standing in the hall. I don&rsquo;t
know.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Try and remember,&rdquo; urged Gimblet.</p>

<p>Miss Finner shut her eyes, contracted her brows, and
gave herself up to reflection.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No good,&rdquo; she remarked, after an interval in which
one might have counted twenty.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you notice the carriage which was driving
away?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t say I did. It was a brougham, I think. I
looked at the people on the pavement.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you see lights in the house&mdash;in the windows, I
mean?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, I think the only light came from the door.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Were you able to observe the expression on the
ladies&rsquo; faces?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh no, we went by too quick for anything of that
sort. I didn&rsquo;t notice their faces at all, except that I
believe they were both more or less young women.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t think of anything else, however trivial?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Miss Finner could not.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If anything else comes back to me, I&rsquo;ll let you
know,&rdquo; she said hopefully. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think you
can find them from what I&rsquo;ve told you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think there ought to be much difficulty in
discovering the house, or at all events the street,&rdquo; said
the detective, &ldquo;thanks for your information, which
may prove most valuable. You must allow me to
present you with the reward offered in the papers.&rdquo;</p>

<p>After a slight show of protest she did allow him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I must be off now,&rdquo; she said, after that
formality was accomplished, and proceeded to gather
her things together. &ldquo;Thank you for the tea. But, I
say, don&rsquo;t you want to know a little more of the
beauteous stranger who is the bearer of the good tidings?
You don&rsquo;t even know my name.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh yes, Miss Finner, I do know it,&rdquo; Gimblet
assured her. &ldquo;You left a card in the hall; I saw it as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
I came in, but I should of course be delighted to know
more of you than that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Know then,&rdquo; said Seraphina, speaking in high,
clear tones and with an assumption of affectation,
&ldquo;know then that I am not what I seem. My name,
indeed, is a disguise, for my father, worthy man, was a
Fynner with a y, an obscure relation of the noble house
of Fynner of Loch Fyne. Though honest, he was
poor; and my beloved and beautiful mother came of a
line as well connected and impecunious as his own.
The marriage aroused the wrath of both families, and
the head of my father&rsquo;s house, proud and haughty earl
that he was, would never be brought to acknowledge
his unhappy cousins. I was educated in a convent, and,
at the death of my parents, found myself at the age of
sixteen alone, and without a penny in the world.
Scorning to beg, I adopted the profession of the stage,
chiefly with a view to supporting an aged and suffering
relative, the aunt of my father&rsquo;s cousin. Now you
know all there is to know about the innocent and
unfortunate daughter of a gallant gentleman, the
scion of a proud, but noble race.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Miss Finner tilted her nose skyward and drew
herself up haughtily. Then, with a disconcerting
suddenness, she winked at Gimblet, and burst into a
peal of laughter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you can&rsquo;t detect something fishy in that story,&rdquo;
she cried, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re not the detective you&rsquo;re cracked up
to be! But I often say that piece about my family.
A poor chap I used to know in my young days, when I
was in the provinces, made it up for me. A poet, he
called himself, and was always making up things;
very pretty some of them were&mdash;if you like that sort
of thing. It was him that thought of my name, and
I&rsquo;ve never regretted it really. But I never heard that
he got anyone else to take any notice of his composings,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
poor fellow.&rdquo; Miss Finner sighed and looked rather
sadly out of the window. &ldquo;He was a good sort,&rdquo; she
added reminiscently; &ldquo;one of the best. I put that
bit in myself about being educated in a convent,&rdquo; she
concluded, pulling at her gloves. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the usual
thing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>With a white dog under one arm and a white cat under
the other, Miss Seraphina Finner, of the Inanity,
talked herself out into the hall, and, after an interval
for the purpose of regaling Gimblet with an anecdote
of her earlier struggles, finally talked herself through
the door and out of the flat altogether.</p>

<p>Gimblet, returning to the little room and absently
rearranging the displaced chairs and tables in their
habitual order, found it more silent and lonely than
before Seraphina had ever entered there, with her
incessant chatter, her boisterous mirth, and her happy
vulgarity. As he moved about the place, restoring to
it the appearance of every-day tidiness, his mind was
busy with the information she had brought and the
question of his next move. He decided on it quickly
as he was finishing his task, and only lingered to pull
back the curtain and throw open the window, so that
the odour of scent that Seraphina had bequeathed
might have an opportunity of dispersing. This he
did, and then taking his hat and a light overcoat, for
the evening was chilly and the weather had turned
afresh to rain, he went down to the street and hailed a
taxi.</p>

<hr class="l1" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XV" id="CHAPTER_XV">CHAPTER XV</a></h2>


<p>&ldquo;Drive to the Inanity,&rdquo; said the detective as
he got into the cab; and when the man
stopped before the theatre: &ldquo;Do you
know Carolina Road, North West?&rdquo; he asked him,
leaning out of the window to do so.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; the driver said. &ldquo;The other side of
Regent&rsquo;s Park, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then go there.&rdquo; Gimblet drew his head back
and sat down as the man let in the clutch and the taxi
started again. It was almost seven o&rsquo;clock and the
roads were comparatively clear of traffic, while the
pavement seemed still more deserted, the few people
who were to be seen walking quickly to get out of the
rain; but it appeared that for the most part the world
was within doors, resting after the day&rsquo;s work, or
preparing for the entertainments of the evening.</p>

<p>The taxi went swiftly, and in a short time had drawn
near to its destination. As they left the more fashionable
streets behind and passed northward into semi-suburban
districts, Gimblet leant eagerly forward,
noting every characteristic of the neighbourhood with
an observant eye and an expectant alertness.</p>

<p>They soon came upon tree-lined roadways, bordered
by houses that boasted small plots of ground before
their doors. Railings enclosed these plots, and in
many cases a minute carriage drive circled from the
pavement to the entrance of the house; but as they
turned corner after corner and the same scene, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
slight variations, continually repeated itself, Gimblet&rsquo;s
hopes gave way to an incredulous disappointment, for
of all these dwellings not one answered to the
description given by Miss Finner. She had mentioned
particularly that the house he was looking for stood
alone in its little garden; but in all the streets traversed
by the detective not so much as a cottage was to be
seen of the kind known technically as &ldquo;detached.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They turned at length into Carolina Road and the
driver slowed up, looking round as he did so for
instructions.</p>

<p>Again Gimblet&rsquo;s head went out of the window.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Go back towards the theatre,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but go
another way,&rdquo; and after much noise and backing&mdash;for
the street was a narrow one&mdash;the cab turned, and off
they started again.</p>

<p>Rain was falling heavily by this time in a cold,
persistent downpour. The wind blew chill from the
west, and the detective, all a-shiver on this summer&rsquo;s
evening, told himself, as he drew up the windward pane,
that there must be icebergs sailing down the North
Atlantic. He wrapped his coat closer around him, and
hugged himself in a corner of the taxi. Again they
splashed and bumped over the muddy, streaming
macadam; the water swished from the wheels; the
driver cowered under his shining waterproof screen;
and the car skidded unpleasantly as they swung round
corners and narrowly avoided collision with other
vehicles in the same plight.</p>

<p>Gimblet kept a look-out no less sharp than before,
but with no better result. Here were houses, indeed,
in plenty, here were gardens and carriage gates, and
dripping trees; but here was no single detached
building of any shape or kind whatsoever. Another
drive Gimblet took, following devious ways. He felt
inclined to ring at Miss Finner&rsquo;s door and reproach<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
her with inaccuracy; but she had not told him the
number in Carolina Road of the house she lived in.
Besides, at this hour she would be at the theatre
preparing to remove the apple which young Tell was
undauntedly balancing.</p>

<p>For an unpleasant moment the detective wondered
if she had merely made a mistake, or whether the whole
tale were a fabrication. He remembered uneasily the
readiness with which he had accepted it and his urgent
pressing upon the voluble lady of the reward offered in
the papers. No doubt she was laughing at his gullibility,
and regaling her friends with an embellished
account of how easily she had taken in the well-known
detective. Gimblet&rsquo;s lips tightened as he thought of
it. Was he becoming unduly credulous in his old
age? There was the story Sidney had told him, too.
He had assured himself that he had kept an open mind
as to the truth of it, and had reserved his opinion till
proofs were offered him; but, as a matter of fact, as
he now acknowledged sardonically, he had believed
every word spoken by the young man, and allowed
himself to be absurdly influenced by an honest face and
an appearance of frank trustfulness.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A nice sort of detective you are!&rdquo; said Gimblet to
his reflection in the little slip of looking-glass that
adorned the cab; and he cried to the driver to go
back to Whitehall.</p>

<p>Higgs was waiting for him, and reported that he had
taken a second advertisement to the advertising agents,
and that he had also been to most of the principal taxi
garages, where he had made inquiries and posted
notices.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The man is sure to turn up to-morrow morning,
sir,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>In the morning there was no news. Gimblet telephoned
to Grosvenor Street and was himself called up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
by Sidney. To him he replied coldly that so far he had
nothing to report. Directly after breakfast Sir Gregory
arrived, panting. &ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t get you on the telephone,&rdquo;
he said. &ldquo;Have you heard nothing?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I had an answer to my advertisement,&rdquo; replied
Gimblet, &ldquo;but I am afraid the information brought me
was quite unreliable.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He told Sir Gregory in a few words of Miss Finner&rsquo;s
visit.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I tested her story pretty severely yesterday,&rdquo; he
said, &ldquo;but there still remains a chance that the man
who drove her may appear, and be able to remember
the exact route by which he took her on Monday night.
There is no doubt her own account is so inaccurate as
to be worthless; and it is possible,&rdquo; he added, owning
the secret dread he could not keep from his thoughts,
&ldquo;that she was only indulging in a kind of practical
joke.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sir Gregory was beginning to show the effect of his
days of anxiety. Though his face was still pink, the
lines on it seemed to have become deeper and more
numerous, and he had the weary, listless air of one to
whom sleep has denied herself. Gimblet was not
anxious for his company, but Sir Gregory would not
be shaken off. The detective said he had letters to
write and business that must be attended to; but was
met by a pleading request to be allowed to remain, in
case the taxi driver should make his appearance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what to do with myself if I go
away,&rdquo; said Sir Gregory miserably. &ldquo;If I am here I
feel that, if any news does come, I shan&rsquo;t have to wait
longer than is necessary for it. Nothing like being at
headquarters.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Finally Gimblet consented to his staying, and himself
withdrew into another room with a bundle of papers
that needed his attention. When he went back after<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
an hour&rsquo;s work to the library, where he had left Sir
Gregory surrounded by newspapers and books, he found
these cast aside or strewn on the floor and the baronet
himself standing by the telephone, in the act of
hanging up the receiver.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I got tired of reading,&rdquo; he explained; &ldquo;nothing of
interest in the papers, or I can&rsquo;t take any interest in
them, whichever it is; so I just thought I&rsquo;d call up
young Sidney, and tell him about the ladies having been
seen by that young woman. Relieve his anxiety, poor
chap, to have some one to talk about it to.&rdquo; On the
incidental relief to his own feelings afforded by having
a listener into whose ears to pour them, Sir Gregory did
not think it necessary to expatiate.</p>

<p>Gimblet showed his vexation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Really, Sir Gregory, you might have known better
than to put him on his guard in that way! Supposing
there&rsquo;s anything in Chark&rsquo;s suspicions, don&rsquo;t you see
that the more complete Sidney thinks our ignorance
and mystification, the better? While, as soon as he
knows us to be on the track, we lose any advantage we
may have?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But&mdash;but you said you didn&rsquo;t suspect him!&rdquo;
stammered Sir Gregory, dumfounded.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t say so. I said there was no reason to take
a tragic view or to suspect anyone at all at first. I
certainly do not accuse anyone now. But day after
day is passing, and the matter looks very much more
serious with each succeeding hour. It seems impossible,
if all were well, that the ladies should not
have communicated with their friends before now.
This is Thursday. They vanished on Monday. I
have been anxious to spare you, Sir Gregory. I know
you have been only too ready to imagine the worst,
and I did not wish to add to your fears; but this is
the third day without news, and it is impossible to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
disguise any longer that you have grave reason for
them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Poor Sir Gregory&rsquo;s last hopes flickered and were
extinguished.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You think&mdash;you think&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; he murmured.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think there is cause for grave anxiety, but that
is not to say that I am without hope. Far from it.
Still, it is necessary to act with caution; and it was
most imprudent of you to tell Sidney that we had
heard anything. It is true that what we have heard is
probably a mare&rsquo;s nest, but in any case there is no
need to go blurting things out like that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sir Gregory paid little attention to what Gimblet
was saying. &ldquo;So you do think Sidney may know more
of this business than he admits,&rdquo; he repeated, half to
himself. &ldquo;Well, perhaps it was a pity I spoke to him
just now, though I don&rsquo;t see what harm it can do
either. The question is, what do you think he&rsquo;s done
with her? Do you think&rdquo;&mdash;Sir Gregory&rsquo;s voice
seemed to fail him but he cleared his throat and
continued with a gulp&mdash;&ldquo;he&rsquo;s killed her?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The words came with a rush, and the question was
plainer than Gimblet cared to answer. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think
anything,&rdquo; he replied, still rather testily, &ldquo;but I must
consider everything and anything possible. At present
it is all mere suspicion, but things look rather black,
though not only against Sidney. As a matter of
personal opinion I incline to the idea that that young
man is innocent; still, I can&rsquo;t admit his character
cleared on that account. I&rsquo;ve no evidence worth
mentioning one way or the other.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who else are you thinking of, when you say things
look black against others than Sidney?&rdquo; asked Sir
Gregory eagerly. &ldquo;I have thought myself, that,
perhaps, the servants&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Vanderstein&rsquo;s servants? I don&rsquo;t think they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
can have anything to do with it. It would have been
impossible for one of them to have got rid of the two
ladies, while they were at home, without the knowledge
of the others. And we can hardly contemplate the
possibility of an organised conspiracy at present.
The chauffeur and footman, you think, may have
disposed of them by some means when they were
supposed to be driving to the opera? But the chauffeur
is an old and trusted servant, and, moreover, the box
opener says that the ladies occupied their box. There
is also the night watchman, who is an ex-corporal of the
Foot-guards, and whose character is of the best. Suppose
that, on their late return to the house, he let them in
quietly, as it was his business to do, and then killed
them both in order to possess himself of Mrs. Vanderstein&rsquo;s
jewels. The difficulties that would then confront
him before he could dispose of the bodies would
be well nigh insurmountable, even if it were possible
for him to silence two women simultaneously so
effectively as to prevent anyone in the house from being
aroused. The probabilities are strongly against the
night watchman&rsquo;s having anything to do with it;
and, indeed, I think all the servants may safely be left
out of the reckoning.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then who can have harmed them?&rdquo; Sir Gregory
asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hesitate to mention anything more to you, Sir
Gregory, after your recent injudicious conduct. However,
I don&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;d be able to warn the other
person upon whom suspicion may fall. It is odd that
it should not have occurred to our friend Chark that
Sidney is not the only one who would benefit by Mrs.
Vanderstein&rsquo;s death,&rdquo; said Gimblet.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, what do you mean; who would benefit?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Surely you know. It was you that told me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I told you?&rdquo; Sir Gregory looked the picture of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
bewilderment. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know anyone, except, of
course, Miss Turner, who would be a penny the better
if my dear friend should die.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Exactly.&rdquo; Gimblet, his chin on his hand, gazed
over Sir Gregory&rsquo;s head at his newly-discovered
Teniers, which he had found time to hang up in a
central position. &ldquo;A little further to the right, and
it would be still better,&rdquo; he thought.</p>

<p>But Sir Gregory was bounding in his chair. &ldquo;Miss
Turner! Impossible! A young girl, sir! You don&rsquo;t
know what you are saying.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I thought you disliked her.&rdquo; Gimblet was very
calm, almost indifferent.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a very different thing from thinking her
capable ... surely it&rsquo;s impossible.... What makes
you suspect her?&rdquo; Sir Gregory finished by asking, his
curiosity getting the better of his incredulity.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t say I suspect her,&rdquo; Gimblet answered
patiently. &ldquo;I say that suspicion might possibly fall
on her more reasonably than on Mr. Sidney, with whom,
by the way, I think she is in love.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Really, how do you know that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have evidence that she sympathised very deeply
with his troubles, and carried her sympathy to a length
unusual in young ladies for men to whom they are not
attached. I saw him last Sunday in the company of
a girl, who I think must have been she. If it was, there
is no doubt about the thing. Anyone could see it in
her face at a glance.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Still, if that were so, I don&rsquo;t see why she should
injure Mrs. Vanderstein.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Love is a very common prompter of crime. I don&rsquo;t
say it is likely, but it is not impossible that this young
woman, knowing Sidney to be in terrible straits for
want of money, his career threatened, heaven knows
what other threats on his tongue, should be prepared<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
to go to desperate lengths to procure him what he
needs. You never can tell what they will do in such
cases; and the one piece of real evidence that I have
shows that she did not mean to sit by idle while her
lover went to his ruin.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Gimblet took Barbara&rsquo;s telegraph form from his
notebook, and spread it on the table before him.
&ldquo;Look at this,&rdquo; he said; and Sir Gregory got up and
peered eagerly over his shoulder, eyeglasses on nose.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>&ldquo;Luck is coming your way at last expect to have
good news by Wednesday removing all difficulties.&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no signature. Who is it from?&rdquo; he asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is from Miss Turner. I was able to get this
form from the post office and to compare it with a
specimen of her handwriting,&rdquo; said Gimblet. &ldquo;The
absence of signature alone looks as if a good deal of
intimacy exists between her and Sidney, though the
name may possibly have been omitted accidentally.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But what could she mean?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Her meaning is plain enough. She promises
Sidney that the money he wants shall be forthcoming.
I do not know how much he requires, but he told me
that the sum is a large one. Now, how was she going
to get a large sum by Wednesday?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She might raise something on the legacy from old
Vanderstein, in which his widow has a life interest,&rdquo;
suggested the baronet.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know the exact conditions of the will; but,
supposing she dies before Mrs. Vanderstein, what
happens?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; Sir Gregory confessed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If it reverts to Mrs. Vanderstein, there wouldn&rsquo;t
be much security to borrow money on. In any case,
there is little difference between the ages of the two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
ladies, and rates would be very high. She might not
be able to raise nearly enough, even if she could get
any at all,&rdquo; said Gimblet.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It would be too terrible if a girl like that so much
as lifted a finger against one who has been the soul of
kindness to her,&rdquo; Sir Gregory repeated.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, Sir Gregory, terrible indeed! But terrible
things happen every day. Let a crisis arise, and you
never know who may not surprise and horrify you by
showing the cloven hoof. I hope that Miss Turner is
entirely innocent of all knowledge of this affair, but
there are two points which are against her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And what are they?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;One is her parentage. I have been making
inquiries about her father, and find that William
Turner was a most unholy scoundrel, a man who would
shrink at nothing to gain his ends, always escaping the
penalties of the law by the skin of his teeth. He
slipped from beneath the hand of justice over and over
again, and finally bolted to South America, where he is
reported to have died. Suppose that there was no
truth in that rumour? Suppose he should in reality
have returned to Europe, that he is even now in
England, in London, his presence unknown to anyone
but his daughter? With such a man to instigate her
to crime, who can say what the girl might not venture?
In any case she has bad blood in her; and there is much
truth, Sir Gregory, in the old saying that &lsquo;blood will
tell,&rsquo; despite the socialistic opinions to the contrary
which now prevail.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;True enough,&rdquo; murmured the baronet. He was
leaning forward listening intently to Gimblet&rsquo;s every
word. &ldquo;But you said there were two points against
her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes. The second is what may have prevented you
from suspecting her before. It is the fact that she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
appears to have been spirited away as well as Mrs.
Vanderstein. Well, if there has been foul play&mdash;which
heaven forbid, but we must consider all the possibilities
now&mdash;if, I say, the vanishing of these ladies has its
origin in crime, the disappearance of Miss Turner is
the most suspicious part of the whole affair. For why
in the world should she share with Mrs. Vanderstein
the attentions of any hypothetical criminal? She
had no diamonds to be robbed of; she did not go about
covered with jewels, having none of any value to
display. She could only be an additional danger, and
one that no ordinary robber would willingly burden
himself with, since her presence could be no possible
source of profit.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, it seems clear that if Mrs. Vanderstein were to
be decoyed away and murdered for her jewels it would
be on an occasion when she was unattended by her
companion. So far, Sir Gregory, you may take that
as an encouragement to think that she is uninjured. It
is indeed a most hopeful sign, and one of the reasons
why I have refused, until to-day, to take a gloomy
view of the business. Still, why has the girl disappeared?
We are driven back on the supposition
that she did so of her own free will; and, if that was the
case, what was her purpose? Remember, all this is
the merest theory, which it would be ridiculous to
accept before we obtain further facts by which to test
it. At present we have a very insufficient acquaintance
with anything that does not involve these wild conjectures.&rdquo;
As he finished speaking, Gimblet took out
his watch and gazed at it long and significantly.</p>

<p>With a sigh, Sir Gregory was at last obliged to take
the hint. It was luncheon time: the footsteps of
Higgs as he journeyed between the kitchen and the
dining-room; the clatter of the dishes as he placed
them upon the table or sideboard; the delicious smell<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
of pie that was wafted in whenever the door was
opened&mdash;all these proclaimed that the hour had
sounded on the stroke of which it was Gimblet&rsquo;s
custom to take his place before the dining table, full of
the pleasantest anticipations. He was an eccentric
gourmet, devising for himself meals in which strange
dishes appeared in the menu, and he had an excellent
cook, who was content to humour his taste and to
labour secretly to prevent his poisoning himself
altogether; so that, when he ordered fried oysters and
Schwalbach <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">souffl√©</i> for luncheon, or lobster and
chocolate ice for dinner, she would intersperse what
she considered more wholesome dishes, such as legs
of mutton and rice puddings, among those he had
chosen for himself, in the vain hope that they might
tempt him from his dangerous combinations. He gave
up remonstrating with her after a while, although he
refused to be coerced into eating what he did not like,
and his persistent neglect to partake of the rice puddings
caused such distress in the kitchen that Higgs fell into
the habit of removing a spoonful from them before he
cleared them away, and consumed it himself rather
than that the cook should what he called &ldquo;take on.&rdquo;</p>

<p>To tell the truth, Sir Gregory was not without hope
that Gimblet would have asked him to stay to lunch;
but it was plain to the most sanguine that the detective
had no such intention, and with hesitating reluctance
the baronet was obliged to depart. He turned in the
doorway, however, to say firmly: &ldquo;I shall come back
this afternoon,&rdquo; and then hurried away before Gimblet
had time to put into words the objection his lips were
struggling to form.</p>

<p>Sir Gregory walked to his club, and regaled himself
on cold lamb and a glass of claret. He had no appetite,
and soon pushed away his plate and wandered into the
smoking-room, where he fidgeted about, disconsolate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
and dejected. Several members whom he knew, aware
of his friendship with the ladies whose mysterious
disappearance was by now arousing general interest
and, as a topic, shared the favour of the newspapers
with the preparations for the Royal function that
was to take place during the following week, came up
to him and tried to get him to talk about it. But if
they hoped to glean from him some grains of gossip
beyond the reach of common knowledge, too scandalous
possibly for a decorous press, wherewith they should
proceed to acquire a libellous popularity among their
acquaintances, these gentlemen were to know the
leaden flavour of disappointment. Sir Gregory, with
the sting of Gimblet&rsquo;s reproaches fresh in his mind,
shut his mouth like a vice at any attempt to turn the
conversation in the forbidden direction, and scowled
as horribly at his friends as his naturally amiable cast
of countenance rendered practicable; so that they soon
moved off, telling each other that old Jones was
becoming a cantankerous old fool and seemed likely
to go off his head altogether, as far as they could judge.</p>

<p>It happened in this way that the baronet found
himself more and more neglected and alone; till, after
standing it for a couple of hours, he could at last bear
no longer a state of things as disastrous to his nerves
as it was wearing to his temper. About half-past
four he put his pride in his pocket, and leaving the
smoking-room caught up his hat and hastened from the
building. Ten minutes later he was again ringing at
Gimblet&rsquo;s door.</p>

<p>Scarcely had he been ushered into the detective&rsquo;s
presence than the bell rang again, and Higgs came in
to say that a taxi driver had arrived in answer to an
advertisement, and asked to see Mr. Gimblet.</p>

<p>To Sir Gregory&rsquo;s despair Gimblet at once left him,
and called the man into the little waiting-room.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Good afternoon,&rdquo; he said to the taxi man, an
intelligent looking fellow with a clean-shaven face,
who returned his greeting civilly as he followed him
into the room; &ldquo;are you the man who drove a lady
from the Inanity on Monday night to a house in
Carolina Road?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s me, sir,&rdquo; answered the man, &ldquo;leastways,
as you may say, I drove one of them there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; said Gimblet. &ldquo;Was there more than
one?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir, there was two young ladies when I took
them up, but only one of them went to Carolina Road.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What happened to the other?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I took her to another address first, sir,&rdquo; said the
driver; &ldquo;I forget the exact number, but somewhere
about half-way down Hilliard Street it was, and on the
right hand side as I went. That&rsquo;s Maida Vale way,
Hilliard Street is.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And you went there first,&rdquo; cried the detective,
&ldquo;why then, of course I see it all now; the lady only
told me she went from the theatre to Carolina Road,
and my not knowing of the detour you made on the
way has led me to some wrong conclusions.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;To Hilliard Street first. Those were the orders
they give me,&rdquo; repeated the man.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, of course,&rdquo; said Gimblet. &ldquo;Now, as you
drove on from there to Carolina Road, do you by any
chance remember seeing two ladies, very richly dressed,
standing in front of the open door of a house, which
had a small garden or yard between it and the
street?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now you&rsquo;re asking me a riddle,&rdquo; said the taxi man.
&ldquo;I may have seen two ladies, or again I may have seen
a hundred of them, or I mayn&rsquo;t have seen none at all.
That&rsquo;s more than I could tell you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t happen to notice any particular two?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;No, sir, I did not. If I was to go driving about the
streets a-looking at all the pretty ladies I see about,
I&rsquo;d be troubling the insurance people a bit too often. I
keep my eyes on what&rsquo;s in the roadway and that takes
me all my time, I don&rsquo;t think.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Quite so,&rdquo; said Gimblet. &ldquo;Of course you are
perfectly right not to look about you. Well now,
perhaps you could tell me this. In going from Hilliard
Street to Carolina Road, would you pass through a
row of single detached houses on the way? Houses all
standing in their own gardens some little way apart
from each other?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The man considered, mumbling to himself the names
of the streets, as he made a mental journey along the
route the detective indicated. In a minute he looked
up.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s Scholefield Avenue,&rdquo; he suggested, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s
all little places like what you say.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you go by it on Monday?&rdquo; asked Gimblet.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I did, sir. It&rsquo;s about half-way. There isn&rsquo;t no
other street on the road with the houses all separate
like that, so far&rsquo;s I can recollect. I&rsquo;ve got me cab down
at the door, sir; why don&rsquo;t you jump in and let me
take you along to see for yourself?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think that&rsquo;s exactly what I will do,&rdquo; said Gimblet.
&ldquo;You go down and I&rsquo;ll follow in a moment.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Gimblet was all eagerness. Here at last he seemed
to be off on a definite scent, and he leapt to it all the
more keenly for last night&rsquo;s check. The door had not
closed upon the driver of the taxi before the detective
had decided in his mind more than one question
requiring an answer. First, he would take Higgs,
secondly, he would not take Sir Gregory. He tiptoed
along the passage, and noiselessly turned the handle
of the pantry door.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Higgs,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I am going out to have a look<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
at a certain house. I may want you. Get ready to
come. I give you three minutes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As quietly, he repaired to his own bedroom, and
going to a cupboard made a rapid selection of various
small articles, which he stuffed in his pockets. Then,
opening a drawer, he took out a Browning pistol, and
that also was stowed away. He stood an instant in
the middle of the room with his head on one side,
tugging absently at his ear. Had he forgotten
anything? Ah, he knew what it was, and springing
back to a shelf he seized and added to his collection a
box of chocolates. &ldquo;One never knows when one will
get back from these sort of jaunts,&rdquo; he said to himself,
&ldquo;and I have been very hungry before now on my
hunting trips.&rdquo;</p>

<p>One more look round satisfied him that he had
everything he could imaginably need, and he returned
to the hall, where Higgs was waiting by the door.</p>

<p>A minute more and they would have got clear away,
but at the very instant that Gimblet, hurrying quietly
towards his servant, snatched at his hat and lifted it
to his head, the library door opened, and Sir Gregory&rsquo;s
pink and anxious countenance peered out on him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Gimblet,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;where are you off to?
The taxi man brought news then; and you would go
without telling me! No, don&rsquo;t let me delay you,&rdquo; as
Gimblet paused, hesitating, &ldquo;I will come with you
wherever you are going, and you shall tell me on the
way,&rdquo; and grasping his hat and stick, the baronet
prepared to accompany the others.</p>

<p>There was no help for it, and the detective surrendered
at once. Indeed, the anxious face reproached
him, and he knew he had been patently a little less
willing to endure Sir Gregory&rsquo;s society than was, under
the circumstances, altogether charitable. The poor
man&rsquo;s distress, though it made him rather a depressing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
companion, bore witness to the kindness of his heart
and was if anything a circumstance entirely to his
credit; and the accident that he bored Gimblet ought
not really to be allowed to prevent him from participating
in the rescue of his friends, if rescue there were
to be.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come along, Sir Gregory,&rdquo; said Gimblet.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVI" id="CHAPTER_XVI">CHAPTER XVI</a></h2>


<p class="cap"><span class="upper">Scholefield Avenue</span> was a short street of
moderate-sized houses, which, when they
were built, had stood at the extreme margin
of what was then a suburb; indeed, some of the
original tenants had called it the country. There was
considerable variety of appearance about them, but
they were alike in one respect: each stood apart from
its neighbours, in grounds that differed in extent from
a tiny yard to half an acre. Thus No.&nbsp;1, at the south-eastern
corner, possessed a large kitchen garden running
back a long way, with outbuildings at the further end,
a stable, with a coach house on one side of the stable
gate, and a chicken house and run on the other. The
old lady who lived at No.&nbsp;1 was very proud of the fact
that she supplied herself with vegetables, eggs, and
poultry all the year round, though, as she was fond of
saying, her house was within three miles of the Marble
Arch. She often thought of keeping a cow.</p>

<p>No.&nbsp;3, next door, had hardly any garden behind it at
all, the ground that should by rights have belonged to
it having been bought up by No.&nbsp;1 in former days and
added to its own; and this caused an unneighbourly
feeling to exist between the two houses, which was
inherited by each successive occupier of No.&nbsp;3. Most
of the other dwellings in the street were more equally
provided with land; and the row came to an end with
No.&nbsp;17, a very small house surrounded by nothing more
interesting than an asphalt path, with a thin hedge of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
laurel between it and the outer railings. Some of the
houses showed the large, high window of a studio.
On the opposite side of the road the same variety
existed.</p>

<p>The taxi containing Gimblet, Sir Gregory, and Higgs
drove slowly down the street, and was more than halfway
along it when the detective caught sight of the
board &ldquo;To Let&rdquo; for which he was looking. It
adorned the railings of No.&nbsp;6, which stood on the left
hand side as they went north.</p>

<p>They stopped after they had turned the corner, and
got out of the cab. Gimblet paid and dismissed it,
and they walked back to No.&nbsp;6.</p>

<p>It did not look very promising, presenting a shuttered
and unbroken front to the spectator, and bearing marks
of age and disrepair. The gate swung on a broken
hinge, and, in the cold wind that was still blowing, a
door at the back banged every now and then with
uncontrolled and unprofitable violence.</p>

<p>Higgs, at a sign from Gimblet, rang the bell and
stood aside, while they waited for some one to answer
it. For a few minutes they heard nothing but the
jar of the banging door and the rustle of the wind in
the trees that lined the street; then they were aware
of a slatternly woman, carrying a wooden bucket in
her hand, who was trying to attract their attention
from the steps of the house next door.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you gentleman are a-ringing,&rdquo; she began,
addressing them in a shout over the intervening
bushes, &ldquo;a-thinking, as it might be, by so doing to get
into that there house, it ain&rsquo;t no good; you can&rsquo;t do
it. There ain&rsquo;t no one in it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s got the key?&rdquo; Gimblet cried back to her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got it meself. I&rsquo;ll come round and unlock
the door.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Descending the steps as she spoke she proceeded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
to make her way into the street, and so in at the
swinging gate of No.&nbsp;6.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Ave you got a horder from the hagents?&rdquo; she
demanded when she arrived. &ldquo;No? Well, I don&rsquo;t
mind you having a look at the &rsquo;ouse all the same, if
you&rsquo;re set on it. There ain&rsquo;t much to see, I reckon,
but a lot of dirt and litter.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As she spoke she inserted the key in the lock, and
opened the door. Sir Gregory, who was nearest, was
about to enter, but Gimblet laid a hand upon his arm.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Please, Sir Gregory, I must pass before you to-day,&rdquo;
he said, and putting him gently on one side he stepped
across the threshold. The woman was in the act of
following, but he motioned her back, and stood for a
moment staring at the floor. Then he turned to
her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I see on the board that the house is to be let
unfurnished, or would be sold,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and I understand
it has been empty a considerable time. Can
you tell me how long it is since anyone has been to look
at it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s stood hempty more&rsquo;n two years,&rdquo; said the
woman, &ldquo;so I&rsquo;ve &rsquo;eard say. There ain&rsquo;t been no one
come to look at it since I&rsquo;ve been &rsquo;ere. I&rsquo;m caretaking,
I am, for a party what live next door. &rsquo;E&rsquo;s
away in foreign parts, that&rsquo;s where &rsquo;e is, and time I&rsquo;ve
been a-caretaking for &rsquo;im you&rsquo;re the first what&rsquo;s asked
to see the hinside of this yere &rsquo;ouse.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And how long have you been caretaking here, do
you say?&rdquo; Gimblet inquired.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been &rsquo;ere a matter of four months come next
Monday,&rdquo; replied the woman.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thanks,&rdquo; said Gimblet; and turned again towards
the interior of the building. He bent down, and
looked close at the bare boards of the passage, on which
lay the dust and dirt that accumulates in an empty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
house. Then as an idea struck him he stood upright
again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think we will bother to go over the house,&rdquo;
he said to the woman. &ldquo;I fear it wouldn&rsquo;t suit me.
At all events, you can perhaps tell me one more thing
I am anxious to know,&rdquo; he continued, coming out of
the house and facing the street. &ldquo;There was another
board up in this street about a week ago, but I see they
have taken it down. Do you know which number it
was, and whether the house has been let?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why yes, sir, they &rsquo;ave been and took down the
board from No.&nbsp;13,&rdquo; said the caretaker, &ldquo;took it down
beginning of the week, they did. But the &rsquo;ouse&rsquo;s let, I
think; it won&rsquo;t be no good your going after it. If
it&rsquo;s a furnished &rsquo;ouse you&rsquo;re looking for, I see a board
hup in the next street t&rsquo;other day. Little Cumberland
Street.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank you very much,&rdquo; said Gimblet. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take
a look at it if I find No.&nbsp;13 is let. Good morning, and
I&rsquo;m sorry to have troubled you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They left the woman to lock up the house and return
to her caretaking, and started off up the street.</p>

<p>Sir Gregory went reluctantly, visibly hanging back.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Look here,&rdquo; he said to Gimblet, &ldquo;why don&rsquo;t you
go over that house? It wouldn&rsquo;t take a minute.
Supposing they&rsquo;ve got her shut up in an empty room
at the top somewhere. Much better make sure.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My dear Sir Gregory, no one has been in that house
for months; the dust was deep on the floor and there
were no signs of its having been disturbed recently.
Do you think two women in long evening dresses could
go in without leaving some mark of their passage so
short a time ago. Their dresses would either have
swept away some of the dust or, if they held them high,
their footmarks would have remained. It is impossible
that No.&nbsp;6 is the house, unless some one has spread fresh<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
dust in the hall since Monday. Besides, it is very
improbable that they should have gone to such a
deserted, filthy building, and, on the contrary, more
than likely that they should go to a house that had
just been let. I felt sure there must have been a
board up at another house in this street when Miss
Finner passed, as soon as I looked at the floor. Come,
here is No.&nbsp;13, and I have a feeling that we shall find it
a more profitable hunting ground.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Gimblet opened, as he spoke, the gate of No.&nbsp;13,
and took a rapid scrutiny of its exterior as he walked
quickly up the short distance that separated it from
the road.</p>

<p>It showed a striking contrast to the forlorn and
gloomy front offered to the world by the house they
had just visited. No.&nbsp;13 was spick and span; its
white walls and shutters shone with the brightness of
new paint; a neat grass plot, with a diminutive
carriage drive winding in a half-circle round it, divided
it from the railings of the street, the whole occupying
no more than a few square yards of space. On each
side of the flight of steps that led up to the front
door there was a little triangular flower bed, gay with
pansies, and, as the three men approached, the sun,
breaking for the first time that day through the dilatory
dispersal of the clouds, cast a shining beam about the
place and was caught and reflected from the surface of
the windows.</p>

<p>The change in the day was not without its effect even
on Sir Gregory, and as he watched Higgs spring
forward to ring the bell a new and sudden inrush of
hope mounted to his heart.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have an excuse by which we may get into the
house if they seem disinclined to admit us,&rdquo; Gimblet
was murmuring in his ear. &ldquo;Back me up in all I say,
but leave the chief part of the talking to me.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span></p>

<p>They waited eagerly, with eyes fixed on the door and
ears strained to catch the sound of footsteps; but
minutes passed and no such sound greeted them.
Higgs rang again; the loud pealing of the bell could be
heard jingling itself to a standstill in the basement,
and must surely be audible all over the house. Still
no one came, and he tried the area with no better
result. Leaving Higgs to continue his efforts, Gimblet
backed across the little lawn, and looked up at
the windows to see if he could detect any sign of
life.</p>

<p>There were muslin curtains in the bedroom windows
and he tried in vain to catch sight of a pair of eyes
peeping from behind one of them; but not a movement
was visible anywhere. The shutters of the drawing-room
were closed, and the parapet of the broad balcony
shut them out from a searching inspection, which was
still further impeded by a wide wooden stand which
took up most of the balcony, and extended its whole
length. In it were planted flowers, tall daisies and
geraniums, which appeared somewhat withered and
neglected, and, with the closed shutters, contributed
the only hint of disorder in the clean and cheerful
aspect of the house.</p>

<p>The detective made his way round to the back.
Here the ground fell away, and the basement appeared
on the surface instead of below the level of the ground.
Another and longer flight of iron steps led up to a door
used, no doubt, to give access to the garden. There
was no bell here, and the door, of which Gimblet tried
the handle, was locked. Through the windows of the
basement he could see into the kitchen, clean and
orderly as the outside of the house, with white tiled
walls and rows of shining stewpans. The table was
bare, he noticed, and no fire burnt in the grate; on a
summer&rsquo;s evening such as this it might well have been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
allowed to go out. On the other side of the steps he
looked into what must be the scullery, and beyond this
was a larder; over these was a small window into which
he could not see, while above the kitchen a large one
was hidden, like those of the drawing-room, by outside
shutters. The back window of the first floor, however,
and all the other windows at the back of the house
were without shutters, and veiled only by curtains of
white muslin.</p>

<p>Gimblet took a hasty survey of the garden. It was
not large, extending back for some sixty or seventy
yards from the house, but bright with flowers and
green with lawn and leaf; trees surrounded it on all
sides, now golden in the rays of the descending sun;
and a high wall gave it privacy from an inquisitive
world. Here again the beds were dappled with
pansies; here were pinks and poppies, daisies and tall
larkspurs, with such other flowers as could be induced
to derive nourishment from the unrefreshing showers
of smuts, which was their daily portion. By the end
wall was a hut, of which the door yielded to Gimblet&rsquo;s
touch, and disclosed a mowing machine in one corner,
some garden implements in another, and a potting
bench with boxes of mould and some packets of seeds;
by the door were stacked a few red pots. Gimblet
stood for a moment looking in, and then went back to
the front of the house.</p>

<p>Here he found Sir Gregory engaged in conversation
with an elderly man, whose velvet coat and the paint
brush he carried stuck behind his ear suggested that
he was an artist. He introduced himself as the
detective came up.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Gimblet, I think,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;my name is
Brampton. I live next door,&rdquo; and he waved his hand
towards the south.</p>

<p>Gimblet ground his teeth as he realised that Sir<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
Gregory had given away his identity, but he replied
civilly that it was indeed he.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Although only a stay-at-home painter, I have heard
of you,&rdquo; said the new-comer; &ldquo;but of course I had
no idea who was ringing, when I came round. My
wife saw your friends at the door here, and suggested
that I should come and tell you that she believes there
is no one in the house. We heard that it was let, and
the other day a man came and took down the board,
but my wife says that no one has been seen to go in or
leave the house for several days; she and the servants
are of opinion that it is empty at the present moment,
and that the new tenant has not yet arrived.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Indeed,&rdquo; said Gimblet, &ldquo;I am grateful for your
information; but I have some reason to think that the
new tenant took possession some time ago.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It can hardly be very long,&rdquo; observed Brampton,
&ldquo;for the Mills, to whom it belongs, only went away last
week.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Really,&rdquo; said Gimblet, &ldquo;you interest me. Who
are the Mills? Do you know them at all?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Most certainly I do. They are great friends of
ours, and their having to go away like this is a sad loss
to us. Arthur Mill is the son of an old acquaintance
of mine&mdash;a manufacturer of glass&mdash;and is employed in
his father&rsquo;s business. His wife is a charming woman,
and we are devoted to them both. It was only lately
decided that he was to go abroad, to look after a branch
of the business in Italy, and they had very little time
to make arrangements about letting their house.
They only left on Friday last, and it was a great
surprise to us to hear on Monday that the house had
been let.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you hear who had taken it?&rdquo; inquired
Gimblet.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think I did hear the man&rsquo;s name, but I am afraid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
I have forgotten it. My wife saw a charwoman going
in on Monday morning whom she often employs
herself, so she ran in here, as she told me, to ask her
what she was doing, as the house had been all cleaned
up on Friday and Saturday after the Mills left. The
charwoman said she had been sent in by the house
agents to see if anything remained to be put in order,
as the new tenant, or so she understood, wanted to go
in at once. That is all we heard; but as no one has
been seen or heard about the place since that day it
looks as if they had changed their minds.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thanks very much,&rdquo; said Gimblet. &ldquo;If you could
tell me the name of the agents I think my best plan is
to go and try to get the key from them, as it seems
impossible to rouse anyone here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ennidge and Pring are the agents; in Sentinel
Street, about ten minutes&rsquo; walk from here. You&rsquo;ll
have to be quick, or you won&rsquo;t catch them. They&rsquo;re
sure to close at six.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will go now,&rdquo; said Gimblet, and he drew Higgs
on one side. &ldquo;Higgs,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;keep an eye on the
front of the house, and if anyone comes out and you
fail to detain him, follow him, leaving Sir Gregory to
watch the house. In the meantime, let him watch the
back. I shall be back soon if I can get a taxi.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He started off, Mr. Brampton accompanying him as
far as his own door and pointing out the way to
Sentinel Street. At the gate they glanced back at
the shuttered first floor windows and the faded flowers
on the balcony.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Mill would be terribly upset if she saw how
her flowers are being neglected,&rdquo; said Mr. Brampton.
&ldquo;She is so very fond of her garden, and is always
watering and attending to her plants. A man is to
come once a week, on Saturday mornings, to look after
the garden and mow the lawn, and I shall tell him to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
insist on watering the balcony boxes. That&rsquo;s your
way now, up the street and bear to the left. Ah,
there&rsquo;s a taxi.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A cab had indeed that moment turned into the
street, and Gimblet hailed it and drove rapidly to the
offices of Messrs. Ennidge and Pring, house agents.</p>

<p class="cap"><span class="upper">Mr. Ennidge</span> was a short, middle-aged man,
with grey hair, and a mild, benignant eye,
which gazed at you vaguely through
gold-rimmed spectacles. Mr. Pring, his partner, tall,
thin, nervous and excitable, was the very antithesis of
him, and that is possibly why they got on so well
together. While Mr. Pring was always able to display
enthusiasm in regard to the properties he had to dispose
of, to the people who were inquiring for houses, and
was never at a loss when it was necessary to explain
that what the intending client took for geese were
really swans, he was apt to relapse into gloom when
called upon to deal with would-be sellers, or those who
had houses to let and were disappointed with the rent
obtainable, or the failure of Ennidge and Pring to
procure them a tenant at any price. He was then only
too likely, if left to himself, to disclose his plain and
truthful opinion as to their property. This was seldom
productive of good results, for, as a rule, the transference
of the property in question to the books of
another agent followed these outbursts; and, Ennidge
and Pring&rsquo;s business being a small one, they could not
afford to lose customers.</p>

<p>It was in such cases, however, that Mr. Ennidge was
seen at his best. It was he who, with friendly smile
and hopeful, encouraging word, cheered the downhearted
householder and sent him away with confidence
restored, convinced once more that a tenant would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
shortly be forthcoming to whom the absence of a
bath-room, of a back door, of gas or hot water laid on,
and the presence of blackened ceilings, wallpaper
hanging in strips, and dirt-encrusted paint, would if
anything prove a veritable inducement to clinch a
bargain most satisfactory to the landlord.</p>

<p>Mr. Pring had already left the office when Gimblet
arrived on the scene, and in another quarter of an
hour he would have found it wholly deserted. He gave
his card to the only clerk of the establishment, who
took it in to the little inner room, where he was
immediately received by the smiling Mr. Ennidge;
and to him he quickly stated his business.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There can be no possible objection to my giving
you all the information in my power with regard to
the gentleman who has taken 13 Scholefield Avenue,&rdquo;
said the house agent, &ldquo;and since you cannot get an
answer at the house I will send down my clerk with
the key to let you in and assist, if necessary, in
explaining matters to the tenant, if he should be
discovered to be there after all. A very eccentric
gentleman, I fancy, and something of a recluse. I
could not, of course, take it on myself to use the spare
key, which the owner happens to have left with us,
at the request of a less well-known and responsible
person than yourself, if I may say so, Mr. Gimblet;
but since the capture of the forgers at the Great
Continental last year, your name, sir, has been in
every one&rsquo;s mouth; and you will allow me to add that
I am, although hitherto unknown, one of your most
fervent admirers.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Thus was it ever Mr. Ennidge&rsquo;s pleasant way to oil
the wheels of intercourse with his fellows.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The name of the tenant of No.&nbsp;13,&rdquo; he continued,
&ldquo;is Mr. West, Mr. Henry West. He has taken the
house for a month with the option of taking it on for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
a year or longer; and I fancy he must be a man of
means, as the offer which he made appears to be an
unusually high one&mdash;unnecessarily so, I may say,
between you and me, Mr. Gimblet; but in the interests
of our client, the owner of the lease, I need hardly tell
you we did not quarrel with him on that account!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What aged man is he?&rdquo; inquired Gimblet.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I really can hardly tell you,&rdquo; replied Mr. Ennidge.
&ldquo;The fact is that I myself have not yet seen him.
Both I and my partner happened to be out when Mr.
West came to the office, and he made all the arrangements
with our clerk. Perhaps you would like him to
come in?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should be glad to ask him a few questions,&rdquo; said
Gimblet.</p>

<p>Mr. Ennidge put his head into the outer office.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tremmels,&rdquo; he called, with his hand on the door.
&ldquo;Just come in here a moment.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The clerk appeared, a white-faced young Londoner,
showing very plainly the effects of an indoor life and
long, hot hours spent upon an office stool; he moved
languidly, as if every step were an exertion almost too
great to repeat, and stood before Gimblet in a drooping
attitude of fatigue.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Gimblet wants to hear about the tenant of No.
13 Scholefield Avenue,&rdquo; Mr. Ennidge told him.</p>

<p>The clerk straightened himself with a perceptible
effort, and stared fixedly at Gimblet, who had long
since become accustomed to the interest the mention
of his name commonly aroused. No doubt this youth
knew the detective by repute; but he had an expression
of such wooden stupidity, and withal looked so
terribly ill and exhausted, that Gimblet wondered if
he would be able to extract much sense from him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was you,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;who let the house to Mr.
West?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the clerk. &ldquo;He came in one day last
week.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Friday,&rdquo; interposed Mr. Ennidge.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, he came in here last Friday morning, and said
he&rsquo;d been over No.&nbsp;13 Scholefield Avenue, having seen
the board &lsquo;To Let&rsquo; in front of the house,&rdquo; replied the
clerk. &ldquo;The owners, Mr. and Mrs. Mill, had only gone
away that morning, and Mr. West was shown over by
a servant who had been left behind to clear up and
follow by a later train. He told me he required a
furnished house for a year. He said he was very fond
of solitude; that he had lived in India all his life and
didn&rsquo;t care to meet strangers, but wanted a house with
a garden, where he could be private, so to speak. He
said he thought Scholefield Avenue would suit him
admirably, but that he wished to take it for a month
first to see how he liked it, and to have the option of
taking it on. I was uncertain whether Mr. Mill would
be agreeable to such an arrangement, and suggested
waiting till we could communicate with the owner, but
he wouldn&rsquo;t hear of that; said he wished to go in
immediately, and would take some other house he&rsquo;d
seen unless he could clinch the matter then and there.
He made an offer of fifteen guineas a week for the first
month, and eight for the rest of the year if he should
decide to take it on. This is such a very high price for
this part of London that I felt sure Mr. Ennidge or
Mr. Pring, if they had been here, would not have let
it escape, but would have hit the iron while it was hot,
if you take my meaning; and as I was aware that Mr.
Mill had left an absolute discretion to the firm with
regard to letting the house, and that he was very
anxious to do so as quickly as possible, I didn&rsquo;t hesitate
any longer, but agreed to Mr. West&rsquo;s conditions.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He said that he wished to have possession of the
house from midday of Monday last; told me to get a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
charwoman in on Monday morning, in case any
cleaning up remained to be done, and that he wished
me to meet him at the house on Monday for the purpose
of going over the inventory. Then he took out a
pocket book, which seemed to be stuffed full of bank
notes, paid me thirty guineas, the rent for half the first
month, and asked me to get the agreement for him to
sign. I got him two agreement forms such as we use,
as a rule, when letting furnished houses, and he signed
them both and put one in his pocket.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps Mr. Gimblet would like to glance at our
copy,&rdquo; said Mr. Ennidge, diving into a drawer. &ldquo;Here
it is,&rdquo; and he handed a paper to the detective, who
turned it over thoughtfully. There was nothing on it
beyond the ordinary printed clauses setting forth the
terms of the contract. At the end the tenant had
signed his name, &ldquo;Henry West,&rdquo; in large, sprawling
characters, the strokes of which seemed a trifle uncertain,
as if the hand that held the pen had not been
absolutely steady. Below, in a neat business-like
writing, was the clerk&rsquo;s signature: &ldquo;A.&nbsp;W. Tremmels,
for Messrs. Ennidge and Pring.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Gimblet put it in his pocket. &ldquo;I may keep it for
the present, I suppose?&rdquo; he asked Mr. Ennidge, who
looked rather as if he would have liked to object, but
on the whole decided not to.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can you describe what Mr. West looked like?&rdquo;
Gimblet asked the clerk. &ldquo;But perhaps you had
better tell me that on the way to the house. Mr.
Ennidge has promised to send you down with me. One
thing, however, before we start: I should like to see the
inventory, if I may.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;By all means,&rdquo; Mr. Ennidge replied. &ldquo;Just get
it, Tremmels, and the key too. You know where they
are kept,&rdquo; and as the clerk went into the outer office
he turned again to Gimblet.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;If you would like me to come myself?&rdquo; he
suggested.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh no, thanks,&rdquo; Gimblet answered, &ldquo;do not
trouble to come. As the clerk is the only one who met
Mr. West, I think he will really be more useful to
me. I suppose he can stand a walk down to Scholefield
Avenue? He looks dreadfully ill, poor chap;
what&rsquo;s wrong with him? Consumptive?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He is ill, I&rsquo;m afraid,&rdquo; said Mr. Ennidge regretfully,
&ldquo;but it will do him good to get a walk and a breath of
fresh air. The hot weather we had last week was very
trying; Tremmels certainly looks very bad since the
heat. I have told him to take a holiday to-morrow,&rdquo;
he added kindly, &ldquo;a day in the country will be the
best thing for him, and there is not very much to be
done in the office at this time of the year. Business is
very slack, Mr. Gimblet. I daresay, now, yours keeps
your nose to the grindstone, at one season as much as
another?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, yes,&rdquo; said Gimblet. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid the criminal
classes aren&rsquo;t very regular in their holiday-making.
It&rsquo;s very inconsiderate of them, but I&rsquo;m afraid they&rsquo;re a
selfish lot.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The house agent&rsquo;s ever-present smile broadened, and
at that moment young Tremmels made his reappearance
with the inventory. In an instant Gimblet&rsquo;s keen
nose had told him that with the clerk there now entered
the room a pervading smell of brandy, and his quick
eye noted a tinge of colour in the pale cheek of the
young man, which had previously not been visible
there. &ldquo;O-ho,&rdquo; he said to himself, &ldquo;so that&rsquo;s the
trouble, is it?&rdquo; Then, with a word of thanks to Mr.
Ennidge, Gimblet led the way out into the street, and
turned his steps towards Scholefield Avenue.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now then,&rdquo; he said to his companion as they
hurried along, &ldquo;about this Mr. West. What is he
like?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s an elderly, rather horsey-looking gentleman,
and odd in his manner,&rdquo; said the clerk. &ldquo;What I
mean to say is, he has a very pleasant way of talking,
and yet somehow he doesn&rsquo;t talk like an ordinary
gentleman might. Seems rather fond of what I may
term the habit of using bad language.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What does he look like?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He isn&rsquo;t what you&rsquo;d call a tall man; not that I
should call him short either; and thin, very thin.
Don&rsquo;t know if I make myself clear?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perfectly,&rdquo; said Gimblet patiently, &ldquo;would you
know him again?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh yes. He&rsquo;s a very uncommon sort to meet
about. I&rsquo;d know him anywhere. He&rsquo;s got a leather
coloured face, which looks as if he&rsquo;d been out in the
sun more than a few weeks, and a funny little bit of a
pointed beard on his chin. Tell you what he looks
like,&rdquo; said Tremmels, with more show of animation
than he had so far exhibited, &ldquo;he looks more like an
American than he does an Indian; and, come to think
of it, he&rsquo;s got a nasty sort of voice, same as they have,
but not very strong.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Anything else you can remember about him?&rdquo;
Gimblet asked. He was listening with intense interest.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, he has got a way of standing with his legs
apart, and getting up on his tiptoes; and then down he
lets himself go with a jerk, if I make myself plain.
His wool is a bit grey and is commencing to get
baldish on the top. He seems to dislike seeing
strangers or making new acquaintances, as you may
say. He gave me to understand that he&rsquo;s a scholar,
and going in for reading and what not when he&rsquo;s
settled in Scholefield Avenue; says his health&rsquo;s bad too,
but I shouldn&rsquo;t wonder if it was more likely something
else. More this sort of thing.&rdquo; The clerk made an
upward movement with his right arm and hand, of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
which, as Gimblet was walking on his other side, the
significance was lost on him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I beg your pardon?&rdquo; he inquired doubtfully.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Granted,&rdquo; said Tremmels; &ldquo;what I mean is, if
you understand me, I shouldn&rsquo;t be surprised if anyone
was to tell me that he takes a drop too much. Rather
rosy about the beak, I thought, and when he left the
office I watched him go down the street till he was
nearly out of sight, when what should he do but nip
across into the private bar of the <i>Lion and Crown</i>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; said Gimblet, &ldquo;I observed a certain shakiness
in the signature of the lease.&rdquo; In his own mind he
was thinking that it was more than probable that the
clerk had accompanied Mr. West to the <i>Lion and
Crown</i>. &ldquo;Did you notice anything else?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know that I did,&rdquo; said Tremmels thoughtfully.
&ldquo;He wore ordinary sort of clothes. Gent&rsquo;s
lounge suit with a large check pattern, brown boots,
and a very genteel diamond pin in the centre of his tie.
Altogether quite the gentleman, and very civil-spoken
and pleasant when not swearing. He told me that he
wouldn&rsquo;t want any coals ordered in, as his cooking
would be done chiefly on the gas stove with which the
kitchen of No.&nbsp;13 is fitted. There is every convenience,
as you may say,&rdquo; concluded the clerk.</p>

<p>As Gimblet pondered over what he had heard, and
reflected that the powers of observation that his
companion showed were greater than he had given
him credit for, they drew near to Scholefield Avenue
and passed beneath its lines of branching plane trees
to the gate of Mr. Mill&rsquo;s house. Higgs was at his post
before it and reported that nothing had stirred during
the detective&rsquo;s absence. Sir Gregory came from the
back of the house in the company of Mr. Brampton,
who had joined him there. The artist was plainly
excited.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Your friend tells me,&rdquo; he said, as he came up to
Gimblet&rsquo;s side, &ldquo;that you think that the two ladies of
whose disappearance the papers are so full&mdash;Mrs.
Vanderstein and her companion&mdash;came to this house
on the night that they vanished. It will be the
greatest favour if you will allow me to witness your
methods of investigating this affair.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;By all means,&rdquo; said Gimblet ungraciously, &ldquo;why
shouldn&rsquo;t the whole street come? I think it is very
probable that it will do so, since Sir Gregory Aberhyn
Jones appears to be perfectly incapable of keeping his
own counsel, no matter whether the safety of his
friends is endangered or not.&rdquo; So saying he turned and
held out his hand for the key of the house to the
clerk, who, panting and gasping after his walk, now
leant against the door as if no longer able to support
himself unaided.</p>

<p>Sir Gregory and the artist, off whom Gimblet&rsquo;s right
and left shots had glanced with a sting but produced no
permanent wounds, fell back silenced for the moment,
though unflinchingly determined to see anything there
was to be seen. The quick, searching eyes of Brampton
rested on the clerk, and he took in his woeful condition
with the rapidity of his trade.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That young fellow ought to be in bed,&rdquo; he said, in
a low voice, in Sir Gregory&rsquo;s ear, &ldquo;but I suppose, like
the rest of us, he won&rsquo;t be able to tear himself away from
this exciting spot.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They followed Gimblet, who had opened the door
and passed through it into the hall. He looked round
him in despair.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Really, gentleman,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;you must stay at
the door for the present. If this house has anything
to tell, it will never do so after you have trampled all
traces from the very floors with your innumerable feet.
I will just see if there is anyone here; and, if not, you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
can come in after I have begun my thorough examination,
as long as you keep out of my way and do as I
tell you. Otherwise I warn you, Sir Gregory, that you
will ruin every chance of success.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He talks as if we were centipedes,&rdquo; murmured
Brampton.</p>

<p>Sir Gregory motioned him to silence, and they
remained obediently in the doorway while the
detective and Higgs ran over the house, opening all
the doors and glancing into the rooms to see if there
were anyone in them. Whatever secret might lurk
beneath that roof, for the moment at least there was
no visible human occupant to divulge it; and, if he
was to arrive at any answer to the problem of what had
taken place on Monday night after the arrival of the
ladies, it was clear to Gimblet that he must do so with
no help other than the dumb aid he might receive from
the inanimate objects still within the walls, or even
from the very walls themselves.</p>

<p>As soon as he had completed the first hurried
general survey, the detective began a systematic
examination of the house, starting with the hall and
passage of the ground floor. The other men had to
move away from the steps while he was here, as their
figures crowding in the open doorway blocked the light,
and he wanted all he could get. There was no electric
light. In Scholefield Avenue, Brampton told Sir
Gregory, all the houses were dependent on gas for their
illumination. Gimblet knelt down and examined the
carpet of the hall on his hands and knees. He took
a small magnifying lens from his pocket, and applied
it to certain spots, which he lingered over longer than
the rest of the floor; at the foot of the stairs he picked
up a small object from under the corner of the mat; he
held it to the light for a moment between finger and
thumb, and then put it carefully away in a little box<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
like a pill-box, which he also produced from his pocket.
Then he stood up, and examined the furniture with the
same patient deliberation. Presently he spoke to the
clerk, who was standing before the door, a little apart
from the others.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you got that inventory?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;Just
read out the contents of the hall.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tremmels came up the steps and opened the book he
carried.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Two oak chairs, one oak table, one mirror, one
mat,&rdquo; he read. &ldquo;One umbrella stand; two chairs on
landing, eight engravings in frames.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wait a bit,&rdquo; interposed the detective, &ldquo;we
haven&rsquo;t got there yet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He went to the door, and called to Sir Gregory and
Brampton.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve finished the hall,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;If you want to
come in, you can, as long as you stay behind me and
don&rsquo;t bother me with talking.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then he turned back to his search, and began to
subject each tread of the staircase to the same minute
examination as the hall had received. From time to
time he added another tiny object to the one he had
already placed in the pill-box; four or five were
deposited there before they reached the first
floor.</p>

<p>In this way the party ascended, a step at a time, till
Brampton&rsquo;s curiosity began to succumb to the boredom
of such ineffably slow, crawling, snail-like progress.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think I&rsquo;ll not inflict my presence any longer, Mr.
Gimblet,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;it is time I dressed for dinner, or
my wife will have to wait for me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Receiving no answer from Gimblet, who was now
absolutely absorbed in his work, he whispered to Sir
Gregory that he would come back after dinner, and
retired from the scene, escorted to the door by Higgs,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
who let him out and shut it behind him before he
returned to his post at the foot of the staircase.</p>

<p>At the top of the house Gimblet straightened
himself and turned to Sir Gregory and the clerk, who
were on the stairs a few steps below him.</p>

<p>Sir Gregory, who was nearly choking with pent-up
questions, seized the opportunity.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you found anything?&rdquo; he cried, and
Tremmels, though he said nothing, was a living echo
of the words, as he strained forward behind Sir Gregory
to catch the reply.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothing definite as yet,&rdquo; said Gimblet, &ldquo;but I
may say it appears to me probable that, if Mrs.
Vanderstein did come here on Monday night, she did
not stay in the house long. I should say she went no
higher, at all events, than the drawing-room floor.&rdquo;
And he proceeded to the examination of the rooms
working his way downwards.</p>

<p>The bedrooms yielded no harvest; they wore the
dismal look of unoccupied rooms and had apparently
not been entered since, having been swept and cleaned
with great thoroughness, they had been left ready for
the use of the tenant. None of the beds were made,
there was no water in the jugs, there was absolutely
no indication of so much as one of them having been
used since the departure of Mr. and Mrs. Mill. Gimblet
did not spend so long over them as he had over the
staircase, but it was past eight o&rsquo;clock when at length
he came out of the last one and descended to the first
floor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can always try upstairs again if there is nothing
conclusive here,&rdquo; he said to Sir Gregory, as they went
down.</p>

<p>With his hand on the knob of the drawing-room
door he paused an instant, looking with more sympathy
than he had lately shown at the anxious face of the old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
soldier. A feeling crept over him that it would not be
good for Sir Gregory to enter this room; it was a vague
impalpable feeling, which he could not explain; and
in a moment it had passed. He opened the door and
went into the drawing-room, leaving the baronet, in
obedience to instructions received, faithfully standing
on the landing, the white face of the clerk showing over
his shoulder, framed in the square of the doorway
against the dusky shadows beyond.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVIII" id="CHAPTER_XVIII">CHAPTER XVIII</a></h2>


<p class="cap"><span class="upper">In</span> the preliminary hasty search over the house, it
had fallen to Higgs to reach the first floor earlier
than his master. Gimblet had left it to him to
examine, while he himself hurried to the upper stories;
so that he now entered the drawing-room for the first
time.</p>

<p>He stood for a moment turning his head to right
and left, taking in the principal features of the apartment
with quick, comprehensive glances. Then, of a
sudden, the whole figure of the man stiffened; and it
was hard to recognise Mr. Gimblet, the dilettante, the
frequenter of curiosity shops, the lounger in picture
galleries, in the tense, motionless form of Gimblet, the
detective, at this moment. He stood, as a pointer
stands when it catches the wind of game, erect and
stiff, in an attitude of interrupted movement, one knee
still bent for the step he had been in the very act of
making; his whole form absolutely still, save for a
series of short, successive intakings of the breath, as,
with head thrown back and his eyes shining with the
keen, well-balanced excitement of the hunter, he sniffed
the air.</p>

<p>What was it he smelt? Something so faint, so
indefinite, that after the first arresting instant he had
lost it altogether; and with it the knowledge of what
it was&mdash;which in that one second had seemed almost
his&mdash;slipped away and was gone, nor could his most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
strenuous effort recall it. Oh, for one more whiff of
that evasive, troubling odour! But sniff as he might
he could no longer detect anything, and slowly his
attitude relaxed, and he brought other senses to bear
upon the scene.</p>

<p>The room was divided, by its shape, into a front and
back drawing-room, as is commonly the case in London
houses; but the two had been thrown into one and the
door led into the narrower back part, so that the light
from the window overlooking the garden, which was
obscured by trees, while it still illumined all that
lay on Gimblet&rsquo;s right, hardly penetrated into the
front and larger portion of the place. There the
closed shutters of the three windows leading to the
balcony prevented the light from finding an entrance,
and it was very dark. The detective lit the gas and
looked around him.</p>

<p>It was a cheerful, pleasant room; not overcrowded
with furniture, and showing taste and judgment in its
arrangement and decoration, though there was nothing
very original about it. On the walls, which were
covered with some light coloured paper, were hung
three or four good modern pictures; the mantelpiece
was an eighteenth century one, and on either side of
it was placed a Chippendale cabinet, with shelves for
china, of which some good pieces could be seen through
the small panes of the glass doors. At the opposite
end of the room was a long, low bookcase and, except
for a large writing bureau, the rest of the furniture
consisted of sofas and chairs, with one or two small
tables. It was a room at once dainty and desolate,
gay and forlorn. The empty flower vases which stood
on the tables, the absence of stray books, work, papers,
or other signs of human occupancy, gave it a look of
discomfort and dreariness; but it was plain, from the
bright chintzes and curtains and the soft luxury of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
carpet, that it only needed the presence of its owners
to assume a cheerful and lively aspect.</p>

<p>Gimblet began his examination in his usual
methodical manner, working his way over the floor on
hands and knees, gazing at the carpet through his lens
at any place where there appeared a doubtful mark or
change in the appearance of its surface from that of the
surrounding parts. As he came to chairs or tables he
moved them to one side, and continued his quest on
the spot where they had stood. There were two small
Chesterfield sofas, one of which jutted out at right
angles to the fire-place before the right hand window
of the front part of the room, the other facing the door
with its back against the wall.</p>

<p>When the detective came to the sofa by the fireplace,
he pushed it to one side as he had pushed each
piece of furniture in its turn, and as his eyes fell on the
floor beneath it a low whistle escaped him: there was
a patch of reddish stain on the green Wilton carpet,
about three inches in diameter, and a smaller spot or
two near by of the same rusty colour.</p>

<p>With his head on one side, and his lips still pursed as
if to emit a whistling sound, but with no audible noise
issuing from them, Gimblet gazed at the stain on the
carpet; and the longer he looked the sterner his face
became; the whistling expression vanished, and he
opened and shut his mouth with a grinding sound as
the teeth met. He rubbed his finger over the marks,
and the patch seemed to crumble away at his touch, till
a hole appeared in the carpet and the white boards of
the flooring were exposed to view. He applied his lens
to the edges of the hole and plucked at the frayed wool
with his fingers. A small piece that he pulled off he
bestowed in one of the little specimen boxes with which
he had provided himself.</p>

<p>Then he replaced the sofa in its original position, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
continued his examination of the floor. Under the
fender he discovered another of the little objects he had
picked up on the stairs, but nothing else did he find of
any interest till he began to turn his attention to the
furniture. Almost the first thing he looked at was the
sofa that concealed the hole in the carpet; he was
drawn back to it with an irresistible attraction. A
careful scrutiny, however, did not reveal much more
than the fact that the chintz cover was rather tumbled.
Gimblet dug his hand down at the back of the seat, and
pulled out the part of it which was tucked down. As
he did so he felt a little lump under his fingers, and
holding it up saw that it was yet another tiny shining
thing for his pill-box collection, and as he looked at the
piece of chintz he had pulled out he perceived several
more of the same kind.</p>

<p>They glittered in the gaslight like little diamonds,
but had evidently come off the spangled tulle of a lady&rsquo;s
dress. Gimblet remembered that Mrs. Vanderstein&rsquo;s
dress had been described by her maid as &ldquo;<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">diamant√©e</i>&rdquo;;
but then it was possible, indeed probable, that Mrs.
Mill, or her friends, possessed gowns of similar material.
Gimblet stooped again, and tugged up the rest of the
sofa covering from the depths behind the cushions.
This time he pulled it all up; the whole covering lay
spread before him in an untidy, unwieldy mass, and
from the end, as he plucked it out, there shot two small
objects, which fell to the floor at his feet. In a moment
he had lifted them from the ground and stood staring
at them: they were a piece of crushed and folded
paper and a minute powder puff.</p>

<p>The detective unfolded the paper, and held it to the
light; it was a sheet of thick white notepaper, and on
it was embossed a crown and device in heavy gold
lettering. Below these was written in a fine, slanting
foreign hand</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>&ldquo;Most adored, I count the hours, the minutes, till I
shall hear for the first time the sound of your voice.
Heaven be praised that I have not long to wait, and
you, whom heaven has sent to me, accept the thanks
of my grateful heart. I send this by Madame Q.&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<p>The signature that followed made Gimblet open his
eyes. &ldquo;Felipe,&rdquo; in conjunction with the crown at the
head of the paper and the foreign character of the
penmanship, could refer to one person only. Gimblet
was well aware that the Prince of Targona was honouring
London with his presence. He glanced carefully
round the room to make sure no one was near, folded
the paper carefully, and placed it in his notebook.
Then he turned his attention to the powder puff.</p>

<p>It was an ordinary little powder puff of pink silk
and white down&mdash;very small, very dainty, if very
commonplace. Gimblet turned it over and over, but
could see nothing about it which stamped it as different
from other powder puffs. Not that it was a curio
in the peculiarities of which he was very well versed;
he could not help realising that in the matter of powder
puffs his education had been neglected. A French
detective, he told himself sadly, would have read a
whole history in this soft toy. He brushed it across
the back of his hand, but it left no mark; he shook it
into the palm, but no powder fell from it. It was
plain to him that, whatever uses it might have served
in the white hands that had formerly clasped it, it was
not of any use at all in his, and in his irritation he was
inclined to hurl it from him. But his methodical
habits prevailed and he felt in his coat for a box to
contain it. And suddenly, with what seemed like an
involuntary movement, he lifted the hand that held
the powder puff, and held it to his nose.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; he sighed, and it was a sigh of deep content.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
Then he stored away the precious fluffy thing, and put
it in his pocket. He finished the tour of the furniture
without further discovery; at the end of it he requested
Tremmels to read out the contents of the room from the
inventory, as he had done at the conclusion of his visits
to each room or landing, checking off each object as
the clerk read out its description.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am in hopes,&rdquo; he said to Sir Gregory, &ldquo;of finding
something not mentioned in the inventory, which we
might take to be the property of Mr. West. But so far
there is nothing that can possibly be his, not so much
as a toothbrush. He certainly seems to be a leader of
the simple life.&rdquo; Then he turned to Tremmels again.
&ldquo;Is there no mention of the chair covers?&rdquo; he asked.
But the young man only stared at him open-mouthed,
and he seized the book from his hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let me see,&rdquo; he murmured, running a finger down
the page. &ldquo;Here we are. &lsquo;Two Chesterfield sofas and
five arm-chairs with loose chintz covers.&rsquo; Might mean
anything. Look here!&rdquo; he turned to the clerk again,
&ldquo;you went over the inventory. What do you
remember about that sofa?&rdquo; He pointed to the one
opposite the door, which, unlike the other sofas and
chairs, had no chintz covering. Tremmels was flurried
by the detective&rsquo;s sharp tone.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I don&rsquo;t remember anything at all,&rdquo; he stammered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What, don&rsquo;t you remember that it had a cover?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Gimblet&rsquo;s second question was still more sharply
spoken. The clerk shot a glance at him in which
suspicion, timidity, and bewilderment were oddly
mixed, and he answered stubbornly, repeating his
former words as if he imagined a trap were being laid
for him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t remember anything about it.&rdquo; His pale
face wore an expression more wooden than ever.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span></p>

<p>The detective turned from him with an impatient
movement, and stood looking down at the sofa with a
frown on his face. It was exactly the same as the one
in the front part of the room, but, instead of a cover of
pink and white chintz, it displayed only the upholstery
with which it had been originally covered by the
makers: a kind of white tapestry with grey flowers and
flecks of red, in general colouring not unlike the chintz
on the other sofas and chairs, but tightly fitting and
leaving exposed the bare legs of brown varnished wood,
which were of a particularly ugly shape.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come,&rdquo; said Gimblet at last, &ldquo;I must go downstairs.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What did you find?&rdquo; Sir Gregory asked him
anxiously as they went down, followed at a distance by
the clerk, &ldquo;what did you find by the other sofa?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The detective hesitated an instant.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sir Gregory,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;there is something here,
some story to be read, if I can read it. The walls are
trying to speak to me, I believe, if I could only listen
rightly. There are things very plain that I can see,
but not enough of them, and there is something that I
don&rsquo;t understand. But what I have seen points to
sinister things, and I must warn you that I don&rsquo;t like
the look of them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Gimblet!&rdquo; cried Sir Gregory. &ldquo;What do you
mean?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, Sir Gregory,&rdquo; said the detective. &ldquo;I am
very much more&mdash;uneasy about your friend than I
have yet been. I fear that, when I am in a position
to give you news of her, it may be very bad. You may
have to stand a shock. Don&rsquo;t you think it would be
best if you went home and waited till I came to you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>But, though on Sir Gregory&rsquo;s face there crept a look
of terrified grief, he would not go.</p>

<p>The dining-room told nothing, Gimblet&rsquo;s researches<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
there were vain, and he soon adjourned to the room
behind it, which seemed to be a library or smoking-room.
The shutters, as they had seen from the
garden, were fastened, but by this time the last of the
long summer twilight was fading and the night
promised to fall dark and windy. Gimblet&rsquo;s first act
was to light the gas.</p>

<p>It was a small room, this back room, where, no
doubt, Mr. Mill, when he was at home, was accustomed
to smoke his pipe and attend to his correspondence.
Two of the walls were lined with bookshelves; one side
was taken up by the window; and on the fourth,
opposite the door and above the fire-place, were hung
a quantity of mezzotints framed in sombre black.
They surrounded a small oil painting that filled the
place of honour immediately over the chimney piece,
and which caught Gimblet&rsquo;s interested eye directly.
It appeared to be an example of the early Dutch school,
and he was seized with the desire to examine it more
closely. The fire-place below it was lined with old
blue and white tiles, and at these too he cast an envious
glance, but the feelings of the collector were subservient
just now to those of the detective, and he turned to
the more everyday furniture of the room.</p>

<p>There was not very much in it: a couple of arm-chairs
stood one on each side of the fire-place, and before the
window was a large writing table with inkstand and
blotting book disposed upon it, together with a few
odds and ends. Even with these the table looked
empty; one missed the papers that by rights should
have been scattered there. As Gimblet stood beside
it, he was conscious of the cold draught that whistled
by his ear, and it was then that he first looked toward
the window.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It must be open,&rdquo; he said to himself, and then, as he
looked closer: &ldquo;By Jingo!&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span></p>

<p>It was a sash window of the old-fashioned kind, with
a dozen or so wood-framed panes to each half of it, and
the usual metal catch holding the top and bottom in
position together when the window was shut. It
was shut now, and the cold air that pervaded the
place entered through cracks in the shutters, and
after that encountered no further obstacle, for the
top middle pane of the lower sash was destitute of
glass.</p>

<p>Gimblet pushed away the table and examined the
empty framework carefully, touching the edges with
an incautious finger, which, however, he withdrew rather
hurriedly and transferred to his mouth. He looked at
the floor; and then, following his usual custom, knelt
down on it, lens in hand. The gaslight was obscured
by the shadow of the writing table, and he had recourse
to the aid of a pocket electric torch. He was satisfied
with what he saw, apparently, for he soon rose and
turned to the window again. He unfastened the
catch, and placing one hand on the framework sought
to raise the sash, but it stuck stiffly, and both hands and
a good deal of strength had to be exerted before he was
able to lift it.</p>

<p>Then he flashed the light of the little torch on the
window sill, and took from it a splinter of broken
glass. After this he pursued his inspection of the room
and its contents. There was, as has been said, little
enough in it except books, but everything there was
came in for the usual close scrutiny; the waste paper
basket was not forgotten, nor were the empty grate and
coal scuttle. In the end, after comparing the things
mentioned in the inventory with those in the room,
Gimblet shut the door into the hall, and ran his lens
hastily over its woodwork. Apparently he saw on it
more than he expected, for he returned more slowly to
the task and spent several minutes examining some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
small spots of dirt, which were visible to the naked eye
on the white paint.</p>

<p>At last he had done, and there only remained the
basement to be investigated. This took some time,
and the results disappointed him, with the exception of
a cupboard under the stairs where he discovered a
housemaid&rsquo;s dustpan full of pieces of broken glass. He
seized on it with eager excitement, and examined the
surface of the tin very carefully with his lens; only to
put it down again with an irritated clicking of the
tongue.</p>

<p>Sir Gregory watched these proceedings in a stricken
silence; his hopes had turned to lead at the words
Gimblet had addressed to him on leaving the drawing room;
as each successive door was thrown open he
felt a tightening of the heart and a sick fear of being
confronted with some terrible sight. Now he would
almost have preferred that the detective should find no
clue, so much he dreaded the solution to which he
instinctively felt that these small discoveries were
irresistibly leading.</p>

<p>The face of the clerk, who equally shared the r√¥le of
silent onlooker, wore an expression of excited interest,
except when he was addressed, when it relaxed into its
usual wooden apathy. At other times he peered over
Sir Gregory&rsquo;s shoulder with feverish, straining eyes,
evidently possessed by all the passion for sensation in
any form which is common to his class; though, that
he was as much in the dark as Sir Gregory, with regard
to the conclusions suggested to the detective by the
various objects he examined, was clear from the look of
something like elation with which he watched the
minute attention bestowed upon the unprofitable
dustpan.</p>

<p>Gimblet returned this article to its place, and
drew out, one by one, the other things in the cupboard:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
a water-can, a bucket, a scrubbing brush, and other
odds and ends. The last thing he brought to light was
a crumpled ball of newspaper, stuffed away at the back
of some brooms and pails. This did not look interesting;
and, while Sir Gregory saw with relief the
handling of anything which gave him breathing space,
Tremmel&rsquo;s face fell.</p>

<p>Gimblet, however, was too methodical to ignore
anything, even so unpromising an object as an old
newspaper. He opened it out on the floor of the
passage, unrolling the crumpled pages and spreading
them flat on the boards. In the middle of the ball was
a small quantity of dust, or rather what looked more
like earth. Gimblet scooped it up in one hand and let
it fall through his fingers into the palm of the other;
it was black and fine, but gritty to the touch. With a
puzzled expression he stowed some of it away in one
of his little boxes, and put the rest in his pocket,
wrapped in a piece of the newspaper. Then he disappeared
into the coal cellar, which was the only place
left that he had not visited. He found nothing
there.</p>

<p>By this time it was nearly ten o&rsquo;clock.</p>

<p>They went back into the hall and Gimblet opened
the door of the little library.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sit down in here, Sir Gregory,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you have
been on your feet for hours&rdquo;&mdash;and indeed the baronet
was dropping with fatigue&mdash;. &ldquo;I am just going out
into the garden, and you may as well rest a little.
As for you,&rdquo; he added to Tremmels, &ldquo;you can go home
if you like. I&rsquo;ve done with the inventory.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s the key,&rdquo; the clerk reminded him, &ldquo;and,
if you don&rsquo;t mind my sitting down here in the hall for
a few minutes before I go ... I&rsquo;m feeling a bit tired
myself, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He certainly looked it, but then he had looked so ill<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
from the beginning that the effect of these hours of
standing about and the lack of food, which told heavily
upon Sir Gregory, hardly added to the miserable aspect
of Tremmels, whatever he might be feeling.</p>

<p>Gimblet told him to sit down, and leaving them went
out into the garden. He walked round to the back, and
along the path which led to the toolshed. Going into
it he hunted, by the light of his torch, among the
implements that leant against the wall; but what he
sought was not there, and he retreated, unsatisfied.
As he returned slowly to the house, he moved his
lamp from side to side, so that the light shone on the
flower beds between which he walked and not on the
path beneath his feet; it was as if he hoped to find what
he wanted among the flowers.</p>

<p>Turning the corner of the wall, he saw a dark
figure in the act of shutting the further gate; it
came towards him and he recognised the artist,
Brampton.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You work late, Mr. Gimblet,&rdquo; he said, as he met
the detective. &ldquo;Any discoveries?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Gimblet did not reply; he was looking at his watch.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It <em>is</em> late,&rdquo; he said after a pause; and then half
to himself, &ldquo;late! too late, and too dark,&rdquo; he
murmured; and again, &ldquo;perhaps it is just as well. It
will do Sir Gregory no harm to wait till to-morrow for
bad news.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What,&rdquo; said Brampton, &ldquo;you have bad news for
him?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I fear there will be bad news&mdash;to-morrow,&rdquo; said
Gimblet.</p>

<p>The night was very dark, for clouds had gathered
afresh, and the wind was getting up again. The leaves
of the trees in the street rustled loudly as if in protest;
from a distance the tinkle of a barrel organ sounded
fitfully in the intervals between gusts of wind.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s as cold as winter,&rdquo; grumbled Brampton.</p>

<p>Gimblet was staring up at the front of the house, and
when he spoke Brampton was struck by the change in
his voice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course!&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;the crumpled newspaper!
What have I been about? Now, ah, now I
know! Mr. Brampton,&rdquo; he said, moving, so that he
faced the other in the darkness, &ldquo;there is something
very terrible here; something to be done that is quite
unfit for Sir Gregory to take part in. I am only too well
convinced that a crime has been committed in this
house, a gruesome and dastardly crime, which but for
the merest accident might not have been discovered for
weeks. No ordinary criminals have been at work here;
we have to deal with some scoundrel so cold-blooded
and resourceful, so prudent, and so full of forethought
and vile cunning, as I do not think I have ever
encountered before. What is your nerve like, Mr.
Brampton? I see you are muscularly a strong man,
and I shall have need of help. What do you say?
Can you give me the assistance I want, or shall I go
and find the policeman on this beat?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The solemn words of the detective, and still more
acutely the grave and urgent note in his voice, thrilled
the imagination of the artist, and awoke in him a
horrified perception of the seriousness of the situation,
which hitherto he had looked on with an eye, half
amused, half derisive, as we may contemplate a game
of Red Indians played by some earnest and dramatic
children. The spirit of adventure cried aloud in him,
and overcame the shrinking of a refined nature from
contact with the horrible.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You can rely on me,&rdquo; was all he said, and thereupon
Gimblet ran up to the door, calling to Higgs to
open it.</p>

<p>The other men were sitting as he had left them, Sir<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
Gregory in an arm-chair by the library fire-place, and
the clerk in the hall; both drooped in attitudes of
extreme weariness.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will you please stay where you are a little longer?&rdquo;
Gimblet said to Sir Gregory. &ldquo;I am going upstairs
with Mr. Brampton, to see if he can tell me one or two
things I want to know about the ordinary disposal of
the furniture; and after that we will go home, unless
you will be guided by me and do so at once. No?
Well, we shall not be long. We shall not want you,&rdquo;
he added to Tremmels, who was struggling stiffly to
rise from his seat.</p>

<p>At Gimblet&rsquo;s words he sank back again, and leant
his head weakly against the wall.</p>

<p>With a sign to Higgs and Brampton to follow him,
Gimblet went upstairs.</p>

<p>The gas was still burning in the drawing-room, and
the door stood open as he had left it. Gimblet paused
on the threshold and drew Brampton&rsquo;s attention to the
sofa opposite.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you remember,&rdquo; he asked, &ldquo;whether that sofa
had a cover like the other before Mr. Mill went away?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Brampton looked at it doubtfully.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t say I do really,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I ought to
know, of course, but I don&rsquo;t feel quite sure. You see,
the colouring is so much like that of the chintzes. One
might never notice it. Still, the legs are very ugly;
I think I should have observed them. And it is not
like Mrs. Mill to leave an ugly thing so plainly displayed.
But on the whole I&rsquo;m not certain about it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you feel,&rdquo; said Gimblet, &ldquo;that there is
something terrible, something fearful, in those shining
brown pieces of wood? Their ugliness should be
decently covered. Unfortunately, I am afraid I know
where to look for their covering.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He led the way to one of the French windows of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
front room and threw it open. Unfastening the
shutters, which still barred the way, he flung them
back and went out on to the balcony, followed by the
two men.</p>

<p>It was, as he had seen from the ground, an unusually
broad one, and extended across the whole width of the
house. A low wall about nine inches high ran round
its edge, supporting a balustrade of stone. A large
green painted wooden box, or trough, about ten feet
long by a yard wide, and as tall as the balustrade, was
planted with flowers, which did not appear to be in a
very flourishing condition.</p>

<p>By the light of the street lamp they could see that
the geraniums&rsquo; petals were turning black, and that the
marguerites hung their heads on stalks from which all
vigour seemed to have departed. Within the balustrade
the black shadows lay like a pool of ink, and the floor
of the balcony was quite invisible, except where the
open window through which they had stepped let out
a narrow stream of light.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Open the shutters of the other windows,&rdquo; Gimblet
said to Higgs.</p>

<p>When this was done they could see better. To
Brampton&rsquo;s amazement Gimblet&rsquo;s next act was to
grasp one of the geraniums and pull it up by the roots;
a daisy followed, and in a few minutes he had torn up
every plant. Brampton, as he stood watching, noticed
how easily they came up.</p>

<p>Then Gimblet called to him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, Mr. Brampton, if you and Higgs will take that
end of the box, I can manage this one. I want to tilt
it up a little.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It needed all the efforts of the three men to move the
box, full to the brim of soil as it was. Panting and
heaving, they shifted it first away from the balustrade,
and tilted it towards the wall of the house. The earth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
poured out as the angle increased, and in a minute the
floor was deep in it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Gently, gently,&rdquo; said Gimblet. &ldquo;Look, what is
that?&rdquo; and he pointed to something white, which was
poking out through the earth in the box.</p>

<p>His electric torch flashed upon it, and the others,
balancing the tilted flower box on its edge, peered
in, and saw that it was a bit of pink and white
chintz.</p>

<p>It seemed a long while before Gimblet spoke. He
stood as if turned to stone, and Brampton felt an
indefinable horror stealing over him, a dread of he knew
not what, but which he seemed to be conscious was in
some way a reflection or telepathic transference of the
other&rsquo;s unspoken thoughts.</p>

<p>At last with an obvious effort Gimblet straightened
himself.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We must tilt out a little more earth,&rdquo; he said in a
low tone, &ldquo;very carefully now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Very cautiously they raised the side of the stand
again, and a rush of soil poured over the edge; the
little patch of white they had seen in a corner became a
large piece, and almostly instantly it was plain to them
all that the greater part of the box was full of it.
Leaving the others to manage the box, which was now
easily steadied, Gimblet ran round and knelt at its
side, scooping out handfuls of garden mould and
disclosing what looked like a very long, bulky bundle of
flowered chintz.</p>

<p>Suddenly, in a voice hardly above a whisper,
Brampton broke the silence.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My God!&rdquo; he said, pointing, and staring with
horrified eyes.</p>

<p>From the corner of the wrapper a hand protruded,
half covered with earth; it was a white and shapely
hand, the hand of a woman.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you see it?&rdquo; whispered Brampton again, and
leant shaking against the wall.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a hand,&rdquo; said Higgs, troubled but stolid.</p>

<p>Gimblet was very pale, and he took a quick breath
as he braced himself to lift the enveloping chintz. The
lighted windows cast three streaks of light out into
the darkness and threw grotesque distorted shadows of
the men upon the coping of the balcony. A sudden
gust of wind made the trees in the street moan and
shiver as though they had been swept by the passing
broom of some night-riding hag; all around them the
darkness gathered close like a wicked thing that would
if it dared swallow up the tiny protecting lights men
burn in self-defence.</p>

<p>Gimblet felt himself struggling against some such
malevolent influences; half conscious fears, some
sensation of evil presences in the air, gibing, mocking,
clustering round to gloat over the results of earthly
villainy, seemed to paralyse him; and he had to call up
his reserves of will power before, after a moment&rsquo;s
hesitation, he bent forward and unrolled the chintz
covering.</p>

<p>Inside it was the body of a young woman. Long
black hair lay in masses on her shoulders and streamed
over the single white garment she wore. The face was
so terribly disfigured as to be quite unrecognisable.</p>

<p>With a shudder Gimblet drew the wrapping over her
again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Vitriol,&rdquo; he muttered, and became aware, as he
spoke, of some one behind him in the opening of the
window.</p>

<p>Before he could turn, a heartstricken cry sounded in
his ear, and he was not in time to catch Sir Gregory,
who staggered back in the embrasure, and from there
slid fainting to the ground. As Gimblet sprang to his
help, he had a fleeting vision of a ghastly face and a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
crouching figure in the back of the drawing-room: it
was the face of Tremmels, the clerk, but so wild and
white with terror, so distorted by the shock of what he
had seen as to be almost like that of another man.</p>

<p>Suspecting from the noise made by the opening
shutters, followed by the sudden and prolonged silence,
that something was happening on the floor above them,
and unable any longer to bear the suspense and curiosity
accentuated by waiting and inactivity, Sir Gregory,
followed by the clerk, had crept upstairs into the
drawing-room without attracting the attention of
Gimblet or his assistants, and the horror of what they
had seen was too much for both of them.</p>

<p>As with the help of Higgs Gimblet lifted the inanimate
form of the baronet from where it had dropped, a
sudden loud noise from the street below made them
nearly let fall their burden; and it was a second before
any of them realised that the sound was only the first
jangling bar of a popular music hall tune. The barrel
organ they had heard a quarter of an hour earlier had
wandered into Scholefield Avenue, and, attracted
without doubt by the lighted windows, had thought fit
to draw up before No.&nbsp;13 and there begin its headlong
plunge into melody. Half the rollicking air it was
playing had been thumped forth, with all the usual
din of banging bass and clanking scales, before any one
of those who stood above it in the grim presence of
death sufficiently recovered his presence of mind to
be able to stop it.</p>

<p>Telling the clerk curtly not to be an ass, but to pull
himself together and follow them, Gimblet, with the
help of Higgs and Brampton, carried Sir Gregory out
of the fatal house and into No.&nbsp;15, the home of the
artist. Here they gave him over to the care of Mrs.
Brampton, a capable, bustling woman with common-sense
written all over her, to whom her husband<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
explained in guarded terms as much of the situation as
was inevitable.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There has been a terrible tragedy next door, my
dear,&rdquo; he told her. &ldquo;This poor gentleman has fainted
on learning of the death of his friend,&rdquo; and the kind-hearted,
sensible creature took charge of Sir Gregory
without wasting precious time in questions.</p>

<p>At his request, Brampton conducted the detective to
the telephone, while Higgs was sent out to look for a
policeman.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is that Scotland Yard?&rdquo; Gimblet was asking, as
the artist shut the door on him and returned to his
wife.</p>

<p>By the time the detective had finished telephoning,
Higgs was back with two policemen, the one he had
found in the next street having whistled for a comrade.
Gimblet went with them to No.&nbsp;13, and together they
entered the silent drawing-room, where the gas was
still flaring and the windows stood open to the night
like three black doors to a villainous and tragic world.
With the help of the new-comers the body of the dead
woman was lifted out of the flower box and carried into
the house, where, still enveloped in the chintz cover, it
was gently deposited on one of the sofas. For a
moment they turned back the wrapping, while Gimblet
searched hastily for some clue that should have
inadvertently been enclosed in it, but there was
nothing besides the body and the one garment in which
it was clad.</p>

<p>&ldquo;See,&rdquo; he murmured in a low voice, pointing to an
oblong incision at the edge of the chemise, &ldquo;they have
cut away the linen there. No doubt the name, or
initial, was embroidered in that place. What fine
linen it is; and this lace trimming is as delicate as a
cobweb! If we had nothing else to go by, this would
show that the murdered woman was rich and luxury-loving.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
Most women, if they had such lace, would
keep it to adorn their dresses with.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He drew the covering over her again; and, going
back to the balcony, stood looking at the half-empty
box and the mound of earth that was heaped upon the
floor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They must have had a job to clear away the
surplus soil,&rdquo; he remarked to Higgs, who had followed
him. &ldquo;I suspect it was carried down to the garden,
bucketful by bucketful, and the last handful or two
were swept up into a newspaper. I found some trace
of it in a cupboard downstairs.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Leaving the police to guard the house, they went in
search of Sir Gregory, and found him so far recovered as
to be sent home in a taxi in the care of Higgs. The
clerk also was seen safely started on the way to his
lodgings, where, Gimblet thought to himself, he would
probably take the brandy bottle to bed with him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You will have to attend the inquest, you know,&rdquo; he
said to him as he was departing. &ldquo;It may be to-morrow
or the next day. Good evening, and don&rsquo;t
stay awake all night.&rdquo;</p>

<p>After renewed thanks and apologies to the Bramptons,
Gimblet found another taxi, and, getting in, gave
the driver the address of Joe Sidney&rsquo;s rooms.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think,&rdquo; he said to himself, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s just about time
I paid that young gentleman a visit.&rdquo;</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIX" id="CHAPTER_XIX">CHAPTER XIX</a></h2>


<p class="cap"><span class="upper">It</span> was close on eleven when the cab drew up before
the door of Sidney&rsquo;s lodging in York Street,
St. James&rsquo;s, and as luck would have it Sidney
himself was standing on the doorstep, in the act of
inserting his latch-key in the lock. Gimblet saw
himself recognised as he sprang out of the taxi, and
saw also a look of unmistakable pleasure in the
recognition.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This man is as innocent as I am,&rdquo; he thought, as
the young soldier greeted him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come in, do,&rdquo; Sidney said, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re the very man
I wanted to see. I went to your flat this evening, but
you&rsquo;d just gone out, so the porter said. I am anxious
to hear if you have any news of my aunt and Miss
Turner.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He led the way upstairs as he spoke, and ushered the
detective into a sitting-room on the first floor, switching
on the light as he did so.</p>

<p>Gimblet waited till the door was shut behind them,
and then turned a grave face to his host.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The news is very bad,&rdquo; he said slowly, and waited
a moment to give time for the significance of the words
to sink in, and to prepare Sidney for what was to come.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What has happened?&rdquo; cried Sidney. &ldquo;Are they
hurt? Is Miss Turner&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>He stopped short, grasping the back of a chair.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what has happened to Miss Turner,&rdquo;
Gimblet said, &ldquo;but I have terrible news of your poor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
aunt. Mrs. Vanderstein has been foully and cruelly
murdered. I come now from the discovery of her dead
body.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Murdered!&rdquo; cried Sidney, &ldquo;murdered! Who
by? How? Where?&rdquo; He sat down mechanically,
and stared at Gimblet. &ldquo;And Miss Turner? Have
they killed her too?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The detective repeated that at present he knew
nothing of the younger lady.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good God!&rdquo; said Sidney, &ldquo;what a dreadful
thing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Leaning his elbows on the table, he hid his face in
his hands for a few minutes, and Gimblet sat silent
opposite him, waiting till he should recover from the
first shock of the news.</p>

<p>When Sidney raised his head again the face he
disclosed was pale and drawn.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Poor Aunt Ruth,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Poor thing, poor
thing. To think that she should be dead. I can hardly
realise it, you know. She has been killed for her
jewels, I suppose, after all. The devils! You haven&rsquo;t
caught them, have you?&rdquo; and, as Gimblet only shook
his head: &ldquo;How can such a thing be possible here in
civilised London? And to think of that beastly old
raven, Chark, going about croaking as he has been, and
hinting that I&rsquo;d killed her! To think of his being
right after all! I don&rsquo;t mean about my killing her,&rdquo;
he added, &ldquo;but there it is, she&rsquo;s dead; and I come into
her money just in time to save me from ruin. I hate
the thought of it!&rdquo; He was talking to himself more
than to his listener, and Gimblet let him talk. &ldquo;I
almost wish she had altered her will,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s
a beastly notion: her death being my profit, you know.
And I suppose they&rsquo;ll say I&rsquo;ve murdered her all the
more now?&rdquo; He looked up interrogatively; then,
as he received no answer, his expression changed and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
he started up, alert and wide awake once more. &ldquo;I
say,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;do you think I did it, too?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Gimblet hesitated a moment before answering.</p>

<p>&ldquo;As a matter of fact,&rdquo; he said at last, &ldquo;I do not. I
don&rsquo;t think so for a moment. But that is merely my
personal opinion and, to tell you the truth, I think it
will be just as well if you can account for your movements
since Monday to the satisfaction of more people
than myself. I ought to suspect you&mdash;it&rsquo;s my business
to suspect every one&mdash;but, as I say, I don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I daresay things do look rather black against me,&rdquo;
Sidney said; &ldquo;it&rsquo;s my fault for not having bothered to
defend myself. You see, it seems so eccentric to me
that anyone should think such a thing. It seems so
impossible, and absurd, if you don&rsquo;t mind my saying so.
One forgets that other people don&rsquo;t know what one is
capable of as one does oneself, and it never struck me
yesterday that you, or Sir Gregory either, might suspect
me. I did go and see the editor of the worst of the
newspapers, and explained things to him, and told him
to let old Chark know he was wrong. You may have
noticed he&rsquo;s eaten his words in to-day&rsquo;s paper. But I
didn&rsquo;t think it necessary to say anything to anyone
else. You see, I&rsquo;ve got what you call an alibi. I was
in the country from Monday evening till yesterday
morning. I met a pal almost on Aunt Ruth&rsquo;s doorstep
when she turned me out of the house, and he got me to
go off with him down to his house near Ascot to play
golf, and I was down there till Wednesday. I had only
just come back, in fact, when I came to see you. I
didn&rsquo;t know about my aunt&rsquo;s disappearance till I read
it in the train coming up; my friend came up at the
same time and stayed with me till I left him at your
door. It&rsquo;s waste of time suspecting me; I admit that it
looks as if I ought to have murdered the poor dear, but
in view of the facts that theory doesn&rsquo;t hold water.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m very glad to hear what you say,&rdquo; said Gimblet,
&ldquo;and I wish you&rsquo;d told me before, though I never really
thought you had any direct knowledge of the affair.
Still, you must confess, Mr. Sidney, that you were not
quite open with me: there was something which you
knew, and which you kept to yourself when we talked
about it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m blessed if there was!&rdquo; cried Sidney. &ldquo;What
was it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>For answer Gimblet took Barbara&rsquo;s telegraph form
out of his notebook and handed it to the young man.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t tell me you had received this telegram
from Miss Turner,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;not even though I quoted
most of its contents to you by way of a hint.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sidney took the form, and stared at it for a moment.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is her writing,&rdquo; he said at last. &ldquo;I wonder what
the deuce she meant.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He, also, produced a folded paper from his pocket
and pushed it across the table to the detective.</p>

<p>It was the message as he had received it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You will observe,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that there is no
signature. How was I to know who it came from? As
a matter of fact, I guessed, or at least thought it
possible she had sent it, as no one else cares whether I
go to blazes or not. But I&rsquo;ve no idea whatever why
she chose to think I should get some money or good
news on Wednesday. I need hardly say that I didn&rsquo;t.
And I saw no reason to speak to you of what only
concerns a young lady and myself. It can have no
possible bearing on her disappearance, or that of my
aunt.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You think not?&rdquo; Gimblet looked at him oddly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How could it? I can&rsquo;t imagine what connection
there could be. But of course you&rsquo;re the sort of fellow
who can read the secret of dark mysteries in anything,
from the Tower Bridge to a baked potato, aren&rsquo;t you?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
So perhaps there&rsquo;s some occult inference that I fail to
draw. By the way, you&rsquo;ve not told me much yet.
How did you discover the murder, and where?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I found the poor lady&rsquo;s body buried in a house in
the north of London,&rdquo; said Gimblet, &ldquo;No.&nbsp;13 Scholefield
Avenue. As to how I discovered it, it was by the
help of two or three facts from which I was able to
draw certain inferences.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wish you would tell me all about it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Gimblet, &ldquo;as Sir Gregory told you
over the telephone this morning, I heard, as a result of
the advertisement I gave you yesterday to have
inserted in the papers, that the two ladies were seen
by an actress on Monday night, standing under a
board &lsquo;To Let,&rsquo; before a detached house in some street
on the way to Carolina Road. I was unable to find
that street yesterday, and it was not until I could get
hold of the cabman who had driven the actress that I
ascertained that Scholefield Avenue was the only
street he had passed through on Monday night which
contains detached houses. I went there at once
and found out that No.&nbsp;13 had recently been let, the
board having been removed on Tuesday morning. I
rang the bell, but no one came to the door, so after
getting the name of the house agent from a neighbour
I went to the office and interviewed the agent.
From him I learnt that the house had only been let
since Monday, and that the tenant was a man named
West who had been ready to pay a high rent for
immediate possession, and who gave out that he was a
recluse, desiring nothing so much as solitude and
privacy. The agent happened to have a spare key of
No.&nbsp;13 Scholefield Avenue and he sent his clerk down
with me to open the door.</p>

<p>&ldquo;As soon as I got in I ran over the house with my
servant, who as well as Sir Gregory had accompanied<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
me, but there was no one to be seen in it, and so I
proceeded to make a careful and searching examination.
Not to weary you with details, I soon found a considerable
number of small paste spangles, or imitation
diamonds, such as are sewn on to the more elaborate
and gorgeous kinds of ladies&rsquo; evening dresses. As I
found several of these on the staircase between the
hall and the drawing-room and a good many more in
the drawing-room itself, but none in any other part of
the house, I thought it was likely that, if they came off
Mrs. Vanderstein&rsquo;s gown, this was the only room she
had visited. There was, of course, the possibility that
they had fallen from the dress of some one who had been
in the room before the place was let, but I set against
this the improbability of the mistress of the house or
her friends being rich people who would wear such
expensively ornamented materials, and also the fact
that your aunt&rsquo;s maid in describing her toilette to me
had spoken of it as &lsquo;<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">diamant√©e</i>.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The next discovery was a most alarming one. On
moving the sofa I saw beneath it a large stain in the
carpet, which various indications assured me was the
result of some acid that had been upset. From the
nature of the damage I was pretty certain that it had
been caused by sulphuric acid or vitriol. Now this is
a strange thing to find traces of in a lady&rsquo;s drawing-room,
and when you find it in an empty house which a
young and beautiful lady has been seen to enter, but
which she has never been seen to leave, and when you
further reflect that the disappearance of this lady
appears to be complete, and on the fact that when last
seen she was wearing a fortune in jewellery, one of two
conclusions appears inevitable, unless you assume that
all these facts are entirely unconnected and the result of
pure coincidence. Assume them on the contrary to
be related to each other, and you are led, as I say, to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
consider two possibilities. So I asked myself at once
whether Mrs. Vanderstein had been decoyed to the
house by some demented creature bent on assuaging a
mad jealousy by throwing vitriol at her, or whether
she had been induced to visit it to satisfy the still more
fatal greed of a robber. And the more I looked at it,
the more likely it seemed that the poor lady had been
murdered for her jewels and that the vitriol was used
to make the recognition of her body, if it should be
discovered, a negligible danger. A few minutes later
I came across a powder puff perfumed with the peculiar
scent your aunt was in the habit of using&mdash;I daresay
you know it&mdash;and this dispelled any doubts I still had
as to her having been in the room.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I still hoped against hope, however, that she might
have left it alive, and I found some evidence downstairs
which led me to think she had been locked in one
of the lower rooms for a time; but if so it must have
been before she was taken up to the drawing-room. In
the library a pane of the window was broken, no doubt
by some one trying to escape or attract attention, and
obviously it had been done by a woman, as a man
could have opened the window, which was so stiff as
to require more than a woman&rsquo;s strength. The broken
glass had been carefully removed from the frame, so
that, but for the draught, it might well have passed
unnoticed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That it had been broken since the letting of the
house was clear, since I found a dustpan full of broken
glass, which would not have been left so by the landlord&rsquo;s
servants, or by the charwoman who cleaned up
after their departure. The sight of that dustpan filled
me with hopes that were doomed to disappointment.
Nothing offers a better ground for the impression and
retention of finger marks than a piece of shining metal,
and I expected to find a whole collection on the tin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
surface of the pan. But to my astonishment and
disgust I could not find a single one; and this
strengthened my opinion that I had to deal with
deliberate crime, and that of no ordinary stamp, for
it was plain that not only had some one cleaned and
polished the dustpan after using it, but that the person
who had done so had worn gloves. And it was the
same all over the house. Not a finger-print to be seen,
except in the room with the broken pane, on the white
painted door of which I found several distinct marks of
fingers. What more likely than that the poor lady,
finding herself locked into a strange room, should have
broken the window and beaten on the door with her
hands in a sudden panic? In the same cupboard as
the dustpan was an old newspaper crumpled into a ball,
which I found to contain a handful or so of what
appeared to be garden mould, and I could not at first
imagine why it should be there, though I can account
for it now. I had by this time been all over the house
and made the most thorough and exhaustive search,
but the only other clue I could discover was a negative
one.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I must tell you that I had made sure that there
was no article in the house belonging to the tenant, Mr.
West, as he called himself; everything was accounted
for in the inventory and belonged to Mr. Mill, the
owner. It became clear to me that West must have
taken the place for a definite purpose other than the
usual one of living in it, and since I knew that it had
been occupied on Monday evening, his object doubtless
fulfilled itself then in a terrible manner and he probably
fled from the scene of his crime the moment he had, to
the best of his ability, removed all traces of it. In his
haste he had left the little spangles which had scattered
themselves in the wake of his victim; and, though he
cleaned up the dustpan as if he feared it should tell<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
tales in spite of the precautionary gloves, he seemed to
have thought the broken glass could not betray him, or
else, perhaps, he had no time to dispose of it. But, if
he had left nothing behind him, it looked as if he had
taken something away.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The chairs and sofas in the drawing-room were
provided with loose chintz covers, with one exception.
There was a small sofa which stood opposite the door
naked and unashamed, in all the hideousness of the
original, ugly upholstery. Not only was the tapestry
which covered it of a meretricious nineteenth-century
design, quite out of keeping with the good taste
displayed all over the house in the choice of pattern
and decoration, but the legs and arms, which were very
much in evidence, were made of brown varnished wood
peculiarly objectionable in appearance. It seems to
me in the last degree unlikely that in a room so full of
beauty and quiet refinement this one thing should have
been allowed to flaunt its vulgarity, and hold the eye of
the visitor with an awful fascination. I felt convinced
that West was responsible for its nakedness, and it was
quite likely that he, a man doubtless devoid of any
artistic sense, would imagine that the absence of that
cover might pass unnoticed, as the tapestry resembled
the chintzes in general colouring.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But why should he remove it? What could he
want with a loose chintz sofa cover?&rdquo; asked Sidney, as
the detective paused.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I asked myself these questions,&rdquo; continued Gimblet,
&ldquo;and I saw that there were only two explanations
which met all the facts. It might be that the chintz
bore traces of his crime that at all costs must be
destroyed; it might be, for instance, stained with
blood. But in that case he would probably have
tried to burn it; that would be a difficult job, and there
was no sign of a fire having been lighted lately in any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
of the grates. No coal in the cellar and no firewood.
He would have needed brushes and blacking to make
all ship-shape again, and his grate cleaning would
probably have been amateurish. Or he might have had
a use for the chintz. It would be a handy thing to
wrap a dead body in before carrying it out to the grave
he would dig for it in the garden. For it seemed to
me certain that after killing his victim he would have
buried her in the garden. There was a toolshed at the
end of it, and I hunted there for a spade that should
show signs of recent use; but to my surprise there was
no spade at all.</p>

<p>&ldquo;By this time it was dark and late, and I returned to
the house with the intention of deferring till to-morrow
a search for the grave, which I felt sure of finding if it
was there. I had little hope that the poor lady had
escaped, but it was still quite possible that my theories
were mistaken, and that even the signs of vitriol having
been used were capable of some other interpretation;
and I gladly admitted to myself that I had no actual
proof of foul play. And then, just as I was on the
point of knocking off for the night, an elusive memory
that had been troubling me ever since I entered the
house suddenly flashed clearly into conscious recollection,
and I knew that I had made no mistake.</p>

<p>&ldquo;When I opened the drawing-room door for the first
time I had been aware of a faint odour, which I seemed
to catch a whiff of as it passed me, so to speak, and to
lose again immediately. During the second in which I
perceived it, its name was on my tongue, but before I
could utter it the smell was gone and with it my
knowledge of what it was. I racked my brains to
remember it without the least result; but, though I
gave up the attempt and concentrated every effort on
investigating what was apparent to my other senses,
the thing bothered me, and I did not entirely forget it.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
As I stood in front of the house after my vain search
for a spade, it suddenly flashed into my mind what it
was that I had smelt: it was the never to be mistaken
smell of chloroform.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was staring absently up at the balcony of the
drawing-room when the knowledge came to me, and in
an instant another light dawned on me with equal
suddenness. There was a great box or stand for plants
on the balcony, and the neighbour who had given me
some information as to the tenant had remarked that
the mistress of the house would be sad to see her flowers
so neglected. Indeed, they were all faded and withered,
and he had implied that it was for want of water. Now,
the thought that leapt into my brain as swift and as
illuminating as lightning was this one: Why should the
flowers die for want of water when we have had constant
rain for the last two days? Clearly it was not drought
that they were suffering from. But how if the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">soidisant</i>
West, having cruelly murdered your unfortunate
aunt, proceeded to uproot the flowers and to bury her,
wrapped in the sofa cover, in the flower stand? It
was quite large enough for such a purpose, and if he
had then replanted the flowers it was probable enough
that they would feel the effects of his attempt at
gardening.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I went up at once and put this theory to the test.
I am very sorry to say that it proved to be correct in
every detail.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Gimblet ceased speaking, and Sidney, who had listened
in sad silence, lifted his head, and asked a question.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The vitriol? They had used it&mdash;as you thought?&rdquo;
His voice was hoarse, and his face stern and grim.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Alas, yes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hanging is too good for such brutes; but I will
never rest till they hang for it. Have you any idea
who are the fiends who did this?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;An idea? Say rather that I have a suspicion,&rdquo;
returned Gimblet. &ldquo;Surely you can see the direction
in which the circumstances point?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Unless it was the chauffeur,&rdquo; said Sidney, &ldquo;I
can&rsquo;t imagine who can have done it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think there is anything in the theory that
the chauffeur or any one of the servants had a hand in
it. There are several things which make that idea
hardly worth considering. But there is one person
against whom things look very black. Do you mean
to say you can&rsquo;t see who it is?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, I can&rsquo;t,&rdquo; repeated Sidney.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Sidney,&rdquo; said the detective slowly, &ldquo;where do
you suppose Miss Turner is?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I only wish I knew,&rdquo; answered the young man; &ldquo;it
is horrible not to know. Where do you think she can
possibly be? Tell me the truth, Mr. Gimblet: do you
believe she is dead?&rdquo; He spoke harshly, and with
averted eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Gimblet, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think she is dead.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Something in his tone made Sidney look up. Gimblet
was looking at him with a strange expression, and as
their eyes met he turned away uneasily. For a minute
Sidney stared at him wonderingly, and then an
incredulous enlightenment stole over him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t mean,&rdquo; he said slowly, &ldquo;that you
imagine she had any knowledge of the attack on my
aunt?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Gimblet was silent; and his silence was more
eloquent than words.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But it is impossible,&rdquo; cried Sidney, &ldquo;that anyone
out of a lunatic asylum should think such a thing. You
don&rsquo;t know her, Mr. Gimblet, she is the sweetest,
dearest girl. The most unselfish, the most devoted,
the loyalest girl in the world! How can you hint at
it? Oh, I know it is your business to suspect people,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
but you go too far! I cannot hear a word against
her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Gimblet turned and faced him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Be reasonable, Mr. Sidney,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and accept
it as a fact that the young lady will be suspected. If
she is innocent it will be better to try and clear her
than to refuse to hear what there is to be said as to her
possible complicity. I understand your feelings, but
you must see that there is nothing to gain by disguising
the truth. It is because I thought it possible that you
might feel a keen interest in Miss Turner that I have
told you I suspect her. I hope you may be able to
help me to convince myself of her innocence, and surely
the best way to do that is to try and get at the truth.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will try and be reasonable, as you call it,&rdquo; said
Sidney, after a pause, &ldquo;and I suppose by that you mean
listening to your abominable accusations. Well, let&rsquo;s
hear your evidence, and if I can prevent myself from
throttling you I will! More than that no man could
say,&rdquo; he added, with an attempt at a smile. &ldquo;And I
feel a beast even to allow you to speak of the thing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am extremely sorry to have to do it,&rdquo; said
Gimblet, &ldquo;but no good ever came of shutting one&rsquo;s
eyes to facts, and it&rsquo;s facts that make me suspect Miss
Turner. In the first place, there is the fact that she
stands to profit by Mrs. Vanderstein&rsquo;s death to the tune
of ¬£30,000.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That applies to me, too, only more so,&rdquo; interrupted
Sidney.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, and I don&rsquo;t think it of much importance,&rdquo;
admitted the detective. &ldquo;I mention it as one of the
points which is outside the region of speculation, and
therefore not negligible. The second fact is that you
were at your wits&rsquo; end for money.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I daresay! But what that&rsquo;s got to do with your
suspecting Miss Turner beats me,&rdquo; cried Sidney.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s got this to do, though I&rsquo;m afraid you will not
like my alluding to your most private affairs&mdash;Miss
Turner is in love with you. We may call that fact
No.&nbsp;3.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is absolutely no foundation for that statement,&rdquo;
said Sidney, flushing hotly, while he could not
but be conscious of a strange acceleration in the beating
of his heart.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is there not?&rdquo; asked Gimblet, looking at him
thoughtfully. &ldquo;Well, we will waive that point if you
like. Let us say that Miss Turner has an unusually
friendly feeling for you. So friendly that she would
go to any length to provide you with the necessary
funds. You yourself have as good as told me so much.
You cannot deny that she was the person who urged
you to try to get the money by false pretences.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am sure she did not look at it in that light,&rdquo;
protested Sidney, while inwardly he cursed himself for
the slip by which, on the previous day, he had allowed
the sex of his friend to escape him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I saw you with her in the Park last Sunday, did I
not?&rdquo; said the detective; &ldquo;I noticed her expression.
I am rather an observant fellow in my way, you know.
I have only seen that look on the faces of people very
much in love. I find I must go back to that, after all,
in spite of your objection to the suggestion.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do object very much. Miss Turner has no such
feelings for me, I am sure, and I can&rsquo;t let you impute
them to her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am afraid you must,&rdquo; said Gimblet tranquilly.
&ldquo;People who are madly in love,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;as I
believe her to be, are capable of any sacrifice, of any
heroism, or of any villainy. In that state of exaltation
they are apt to lose their sense of proportion, and to
confound extremes; they may see in the basest depths
of infamy only another aspect of noble heights of self-abnegation;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
if the object of their affections is in
danger, they may consider no expedient too shameful
if it can be made to provide a means of extricating
him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is nothing inherently impossible in imagining
that Miss Turner, conscious of nothing but your need,
blindly strove to supply it and was in no mood to
boggle at any feasible method. I don&rsquo;t know if you
are aware of the character borne by her father. He
was a man of the worst reputation: an utterly merciless
and unscrupulous swindler. His daughter may not
have escaped the taint of heredity; it is, at all events,
conceivable that her principles suffered from her early
association with him. He is said to have died in South
America, where he was obliged to fly to escape his just
deserts, but there is no proof at all that he really did
die.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know that I am for the moment dealing in theory,
if I say, suppose this man to be secretly in London and
in secret communication with his daughter. Suppose
she let him see how direly she needed money at this
moment. Might not a scoundrel of his description
seize the opportunity to persuade her to help him in
some such nefarious business as the robbery of Mrs.
Vanderstein, and secure her silence, if not her assistance,
in even a more dastardly business? To return to the
realm of fact; the order to the motor not to fetch the
ladies from the opera was given by Miss Turner. She
ran back alone to tell the chauffeur, after your aunt had
gone into the theatre. She had previously sent you
this wire, in which she was very positive that the
money you required would be forthcoming.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She was seen by Miss Finner standing at the door
of the house in Scholefield Avenue in the company of
your aunt, and it is not too much to presume that she
subsequently entered it with her. There would be no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
imaginable motive to induce a thief or gang of thieves
to decoy her to the house: she had no jewels to be
deprived of. There would be, on the contrary, every
reason why she should be prevented from going anywhere
near the place. Since, then, she assuredly went
there on her own initiative, it seems probable that Mrs.
Vanderstein was persuaded to accompany her by the
girl herself.</p>

<p>&ldquo;To go back for the moment to speculation, one
may imagine that it was old Turner who masqueraded
as West, the tenant, who is described as a horsey-looking
elderly man who had lived much in a hot
climate. This accords with a description of Turner
I took the trouble to obtain yesterday, with the
exception of the beard or imperial worn by West, which
he may easily have grown of late years. It may have
been the girl&rsquo;s father, therefore, who opened the door
to the two women, and who, once he had her safe
inside, first locked your aunt in the library while he
finished his preparations upstairs, and then led her to
the drawing-room, as in times more in harmony with his
deeds he might have led her to the nearest tree.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Finally, in support of this theory, or at least of Miss
Turner&rsquo;s complicity in the affair, we have the facts that
the two ladies were last seen together, and that, while
the one has been found robbed and murdered, the
other has departed without a word or a sign. It is only
too likely that she is half way to America. The ports
are being watched, but by now it is probably too late.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Gimblet finished speaking and sat watching the face
of the younger man. Sidney looked troubled, but his
manner was confident as he gave his opinion.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If she has not been heard of,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;it is
because for some reason she is unable to communicate
with anyone. I have heard all your arguments
attentively, Mr. Gimblet, and I must confess that you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
have not in the least convinced me that there is
anything in your idea. It all sounds very plausible,
no doubt, but if you knew the young lady as I have the
pleasure of doing you would see that the whole thing is
ridiculous. No one can be what she is and act in the
way you suggest. Her nature is such as to put it out
of the question. I can only repeat that the thing is
ludicrously impossible, and that if you knew her you
would be the first to see it. However, I agree with you
that the best way of proving what I say is to find the
real murderer. My only fear is that to-morrow you
may discover that she too has been killed and buried in
the garden.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am not afraid of that,&rdquo; said Gimblet, &ldquo;because,
as I tell you, if her presence had not been desirable
she would never have been near the place. She would
have been kept as unaware of its existence as you
were yourself. The first essential of such a plan as
the murderer must have concocted would be to get
hold of Mrs. Vanderstein alone and unsuspected by
anyone who was not a confederate.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sidney made an impatient movement.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am absolutely convinced that Miss Turner had
nothing whatever to do with it,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; returned Gimblet as he rose to go, &ldquo;I hope
you are right and that further investigations will lead
me to share your view. If we can lay hands on Mr.
West we shall get at the truth, and unless he is very
careful how he disposes of the jewels we are sure to
catch him. From what I hear, Mrs. Vanderstein&rsquo;s rope
of pearls is well known to every jeweller in Europe;
and, if he tries to sell so much as one of them, he&rsquo;ll find
a very different sort of rope around his neck. Now I
must be off; they are expecting me at Scotland Yard.&rdquo;</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XX" id="CHAPTER_XX">CHAPTER XX</a></h2>


<p class="cap"><span class="upper">It</span> was long past one when at last Gimblet got to bed.
He had had a long and tiring day, full of strain
and excitement, and his head was no sooner on
the pillow than he slept soundly and dreamlessly.
It seemed to him that he had only just shut his eyes
when Higgs awoke him the next morning by coming in
with his hot water. He rolled over yawning and
rubbing his eyes, as his servant pulled up the blinds and
laid ready his clothes. When he had finished and gone
away, the detective turned over again for another
snooze; but in a minute Higgs was back again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The young man from Ennidge and Pring has called,
sir,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;the clerk who came with the key last
evening, you know, sir. He wants to know if the
inquest is to be to-day, as, if not, he has been given a
holiday and is going to spend it in the country.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He can go,&rdquo; said Gimblet; &ldquo;the inquest won&rsquo;t be
till to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He was thoroughly awakened by now, and went to
his bath as soon as Higgs had departed.</p>

<p>Breakfast was on the table when he entered the
dining-room, and he helped himself to omelet and sat
down and poured out his tea before he took up the
morning paper, which lay beside his plate.</p>

<p>As he folded back the sheet and cast his eye over the
page, he uttered a startled exclamation and sat staring
incredulously at the paper as he read:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="center">MYSTERY OF MISSING LADIES PROVES
MYTHICAL.</p>

<p class="hd">Mrs. Vanderstein is Staying at Boulogne.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Our correspondent at Boulogne telegraphs that
Mrs. Vanderstein, of 90 Grosvenor Street, is staying at
the H√¥tel de Douvres in that town. Having observed
her name in the visitors&rsquo; book of the hotel, our correspondent
inquired of the manager if the lady could be
she who had been reported missing for the last two or
three days, and learnt that, while the manager was
unaware of the anxiety which has been felt in England
on her account, it is certainly Mrs. Vanderstein, of 90
Grosvenor Street, who is at present beneath his roof.
Further conversation with the affable and obliging host
of the H√¥tel de Douvres elicited the information that
the lady arrived early on Tuesday morning with the
intention of staying for one night only. She complained
of feeling indisposed, however, and sent for a
doctor, who ordered complete rest; so that Mrs.
Vanderstein kept her room till this evening, when, her
health being improved, she dined in her apartment as
usual, but afterwards went out to the Casino.</p>

<p>&ldquo;As luck would have it, the manager was relating
these details to our correspondent at the very moment&mdash;about
11 p.m.&mdash;when a carriage drove up to the
door, and the lady herself re-entered the hotel. On
our correspondent&rsquo;s introducing himself and explaining
that grave anxiety was being felt on her
behalf in this country, she expressed considerable
astonishment, and said that this explained the fact
that letters she had written had not been answered.
She conjectured further that they could not even have
been delivered, remarking that the French postal
system left much to be desired. In reply to further
questions, the lady proclaimed her aversion to being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
interviewed, and said merely that she would send some
telegrams in the morning; upon which our correspondent
withdrew, and she entered the lift and mounted
to the first floor, where she has a suite of rooms.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Vanderstein, who appeared to be entirely
recovered in health, was elegantly dressed in a black
and white casino costume, with a rose coloured toque
trimmed with an osprey, which was very becoming to
her dark hair and superb complexion. She was wearing
some of the magnificent jewels with which rumour
has been so busy during the last few days.&rdquo;</p></div>

<p>Gimblet read the paragraph twice, and then pushing
back his chair walked restlessly about the room. His
appetite was gone for the time being; his eyes glowed
again with the excitement of a new problem. One
second he spared, in which to be glad that Mrs. Vanderstein
still lived; he was glad for Sir Gregory&rsquo;s sake, and
for Sidney&rsquo;s sake, and even a little for her own, though
he had never to his knowledge set eyes on her. But
from the first he had felt an indefinable sympathy for
the fastidious lady whose house was scented with the
delicate, delicious perfume that he associated with her
name. But, as a matter of fact, Mrs. Vanderstein,
alive and well and disporting herself at Boulogne,
slipped quickly out of the place in Gimblet&rsquo;s
interest hitherto filled by Mrs. Vanderstein dead and
cruelly murdered. His mind now occupied itself
busily and eagerly with the questions raised by
this shifting of r√¥les in the tragedy of Scholefield
Avenue.</p>

<p>If Mrs. Vanderstein had not played the piteous part
of the victim on that fatal Monday night, who had?
Not Miss Barbara Turner, for she was described as
having very fair hair, while that of the murdered woman
was very dark. And if Miss Turner were not flying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
from justice, where was she? Could she and Mrs.
Vanderstein have combined to kill their hostess, when
they visited the house hired by Mr. West of tropical
origin? In any case here was a tangled knot to
unravel, and a black crime to bring home to its
perpetrator. Gimblet saw that he was not likely to
solve the puzzle off-hand, and reflected that in the
meantime he had better fortify himself with food
while he had the opportunity. His breakfast was
rather cold by the time he again sat down to it.</p>

<p>What, in heaven&rsquo;s name, had Mrs. Vanderstein and
Miss Turner been doing in that house on Monday
night? Had Miss Finner been mistaken, after all, and
was it not they whom she had seen before the door?
If so, by what astounding coincidence had he been led
to search there of all places, by what incredible freak
had Fortune taken him to the scene of this black and
cold-blooded crime? His brain, while he ate, busied
itself with these and such-like riddles.</p>

<p>Soon after breakfast a high official from the Yard
called for him in accordance with arrangements made
the night before, and they set forth together in a taxi
for Fianti&rsquo;s.</p>

<p>&ldquo;For,&rdquo; said the official, as they went, &ldquo;whether it
was Mrs. Vanderstein or some one else whose body you
found, we want the man who did it equally badly, and
we want your help in finding him. I suppose your
commission from Sir Gregory Aberhyn Jones dies a
natural death now?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suppose so,&rdquo; said Gimblet, &ldquo;but I&rsquo;ll see him
presently and let you know. There&rsquo;s still Miss Turner
to account for, but I daresay she&rsquo;s at Boulogne too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;As likely as not,&rdquo; agreed his companion. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
just the sort of little detail they&rsquo;d forget to mention.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, we shall soon know,&rdquo; was Gimblet&rsquo;s only
comment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span></p>

<p>At Fianti&rsquo;s they sent up their cards by the detective
of the regular force who was always in attendance on
the Prince and Princess of Targona, with a request for
the favour of an audience. They had not long to wait,
and were very graciously received by Prince Felipe,
who listened with grave attention to the explanation of
the object of their visit, and read the note presented for
his inspection by Gimblet with a lively curiosity.</p>

<p>No, His Highness was afraid he could not assist them
in this matter. The writing paper was certainly his&mdash;how
obtained he could offer no suggestion&mdash;the
writing was of course a forgery, if that could be called
a forgery which made absolutely no pretence of
resembling the original. He had no notion to whom
the appellation of Madame Q. might refer. No doubt
more than one lady whose name began with that
initial had been presented to him on different occasions,
but he could not for the moment recall.... Possibly
some of his suite could be of more assistance.</p>

<p>But no one of the Prince&rsquo;s household could give them
any help. In the matter of the writing paper, it was
suggested that the hotel servants might know something
as to how it was obtained, but nothing definite
could be found out about it.</p>

<p>The Prince sent for them again before they left, but
it was only to say that they had his best wishes for the
success of their investigations, and to ask a few
questions as to points of English police procedure in
which he appeared to be interested.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Truly, a strange country!&rdquo; he murmured from
time to time on receiving the answers to his inquiries.</p>

<p>Before they were dismissed, Gimblet once more
produced the crumpled paper which bore the Targona
arms over the Prince&rsquo;s name, and asked the
Prince if he could detect a certain odour which clung
about it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Delicious,&rdquo; said Prince Felipe, when he had
pressed it to his nose, &ldquo;a delicate, pungent fragrance!
But no, I do not know what it is.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The official parted from Gimblet at the door of
Fianti&rsquo;s and while the one returned in a hurried taxi to
his sanctum at Scotland Yard, the other strolled
across the street to Mrs. Vanderstein&rsquo;s house.</p>

<p>He found a relieved and rejoicing household.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve seen the news, of course, sir,&rdquo; said Blake,
himself opening the door in answer to the detective&rsquo;s
ring. &ldquo;And we&rsquo;ve had a telegram this morning.
Here it is.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He handed it to Gimblet, who read:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>&ldquo;Blake 90 Grosvenor Street London W. Think
letters must have missed am staying at Hotel de
Douvres Boulogne till further notice writing.</p>

<p class="right">
&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Vanderstein.</span>&rdquo;
</p>
</div>

<p>The telegram had been sent off at 8.14 that morning.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suppose Miss Turner is with her, sir,&rdquo; Blake was
saying, as Gimblet gave him back the paper, &ldquo;the
newspaper doesn&rsquo;t mention her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Gimblet. &ldquo;Still, as you say, I daresay
she is there all the same. It is Mrs. Vanderstein, and
above all Mrs. Vanderstein&rsquo;s jewels, that the public is
interested in.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He went back to his flat, where he found Sidney and
Sir Gregory, both radiant.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What splendid news!&rdquo; Sir Gregory greeted him
as they met, with a joyful cry. &ldquo;I could not believe
it at first; it seems too good to be true. But oh, Mr.
Gimblet! what a night I have spent! I shall send
that reporter man a fiver. These newspaper chaps
sometimes have their uses, after all!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hope you see now,&rdquo; Sidney remarked, &ldquo;what a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
mistake it is to suspect people of doing impossible
things.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sir Gregory looked towards them with a puzzled
expression. Gimblet, however, merely smiled.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am delighted to be in the wrong, Mr. Sidney,&rdquo;
was all he said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She will laugh when she hears what a fuss I&rsquo;ve
been making,&rdquo; resumed Sir Gregory, pursuing his own
thoughts. &ldquo;I think I shall run over to Boulogne
to-morrow and see her. I assure you, Mr. Gimblet,
I feel ten years younger again. What a nightmare it
has been!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I found a wire for me at the club,&rdquo; put in Sidney;
&ldquo;she says she is sorry we have been worried, and that
her letter must have missed the post. It&rsquo;s jolly good of
her to wire to me; I didn&rsquo;t think she meant to have
anything more to do with me when I last saw her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It looks as if she had forgiven you, doesn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;
said Gimblet.</p>

<p>He was thinking that it was not every young man in
Sidney&rsquo;s position who would have looked so delighted
to hear that his aunt was alive after all, when all his
difficulties seemed removed by her supposed death.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She doesn&rsquo;t say a word about Miss Turner,&rdquo; Sidney
continued. &ldquo;She might have, you&rsquo;d think. Of course
she doesn&rsquo;t realise in the least that we&rsquo;ve been imagining
her murdered.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I telegraphed this morning as soon as I&rsquo;d seen the
paper,&rdquo; said Sir Gregory, &ldquo;and said we had been most
anxious and that I trusted they were both well. I
expect there will be an answer for me by the time I
get back. Must be going now in fact. You see she
has been ill; kept her room till last night, the hotel man
said.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a very odd business,&rdquo; said Gimblet. &ldquo;I have
done a little telegraphing on my own account, I may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
tell you, for I want to know whether Mrs. Vanderstein
did go to Scholefield Avenue, or whether Miss Finner
took some one else for her. I ought to get the reply
any minute. And the police are sending a man of
theirs over to see her, by the afternoon boat. They
want me to help them with investigations of the
tragedy we discovered yesterday. I suppose, Sir
Gregory, that I can be of no further use to you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thankee, Mr. Gimblet, I hope I shan&rsquo;t trouble you
any more.&rdquo;</p>

<p>After a little more mutual congratulation the two
visitors took themselves off, and Gimblet composed
himself to await the answer to his telegram, which was
now due.</p>

<p>He was sitting contemplating his Teniers, the
beauties of which he had not had much leisure to gaze
at of late, and munching sweets as he mused, when the
expected ring came at the door of the flat; but instead
of the message he thought to receive it was Inspector
Jennins from Scotland Yard, an astute and good-humoured
officer, who had before now been his
associate in more than one important case.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I came round to tell you, Mr. Gimblet,&rdquo; he
exclaimed as he was shown in, &ldquo;that the young lady
has been found.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What, Miss Turner?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s it. She&rsquo;s in the Middlesex Hospital and,
what&rsquo;s more, has been there all the time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then how in the world was it that no one knew
it? That was one of the first places I inquired at, and
I daresay you did too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes; she was brought in on Wednesday morning
about 3 a.m. by a police constable who had been on
night duty in Regent&rsquo;s Park. He saw her knocked
down by a man, and picked her up unconscious, and
she has been so ever since. The man got away in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
dark, and at the hospital no one recognised the young
lady from the description given in the inquiries that
were made, as the account of the clothes she wore was
all wrong. But there have been a lot of photographs
of her and Mrs. Vanderstein in the papers to-day and
yesterday, and this morning one of the nurses who&rsquo;d
been studying her portrait recognised the original in
spite of her wounds. The hospital authorities communicated
with us, and I&rsquo;m off to the hospital now. I
thought perhaps you&rsquo;d like to come.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should, certainly,&rdquo; said Gimblet, and they were
soon on their way.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have only once seen Miss Turner, and that was
only a passing glimpse,&rdquo; Gimblet said as the taxi sped
along. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think it would be a good plan to
take one of the Grosvenor Street servants with us to
identify the young lady? It is possible that the nurse
may be mistaken; people look so different in a
horizontal position. And their saying that her clothes
were wrongly described looks to me as if there were
some error somewhere.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think that&rsquo;s a very good idea of yours,&rdquo; agreed
Jennins, and putting his head out of the window he
told the driver to go to 90 Grosvenor Street.</p>

<p>They called for Am√©lie, Mrs. Vanderstein&rsquo;s maid, who
appeared after a few minutes, in high delight and
excitement at the prospect of assisting the police. She
looked rather reproachfully at Gimblet, as though she
would have liked to point out to him that it was to be
regretted that he had hitherto failed to appreciate how
valuable her co-operation might be. &ldquo;Ah, cette pauvre
demoiselle,&rdquo; she murmured as they got into the cab;
and her manner indicated that she would have liked
to add: &ldquo;How different it would have been if you had
consulted me earlier.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At the hospital there was a little delay before they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
were led upstairs and handed over to the guidance of a
pleasant-faced nurse who led them to a ward full of
casualty cases, which had suffered various injuries at
the hands of Fortune.</p>

<p>In one bed was a woman who had been knocked down
by a van; in the next a child who had fallen into the
kitchen fire; in the third a woman whose husband had
kicked her to the very verge of the grave; the fourth
held a girl with an arm crushed in the machinery of
the factory she worked in&mdash;so the nurse informed the
inspector.</p>

<p>She led the party through the ward, keeping up a
running commentary as they advanced, till they
reached the end bed of all, in which lay a young girl
whose head was covered with bandages, and who lay
quiet and still as if asleep.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here she is,&rdquo; said their guide.</p>

<p>Gimblet looked at Am√©lie.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mais oui, monsieur,&rdquo; she answered his unspoken
question. &ldquo;C&rsquo;est bien Mademoiselle Turner. Ah,
l√† l√†! the poor one, what have they done to her?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Barbara looked terribly white and fragile. Her
face had grown thin to emaciation, and there were deep
blue lines under her eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Poor young lady,&rdquo; said the nurse, &ldquo;she&rsquo;s got
concussion of the brain, and it must have been a
frightful blow that did it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When they left the ward Gimblet asked: &ldquo;How
was it Miss Turner was not recognised till to-day?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the nurse, &ldquo;you see the pictures in
the papers aren&rsquo;t very good, and her hair is so hidden
by the bandages that it&rsquo;s rather hard to see the likeness.
But what really put us off here was the description of
the clothes she was supposed to have been wearing. Of
course no one ever thought of connecting her with a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
young lady in a white evening dress and a red opera
cloak!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why,&rdquo; asked Jennins, &ldquo;were those not the colours
she wore?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just wait a moment,&rdquo; said the nurse; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll show
you her things.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She hurried away and returned in a minute with a
bundle of apparel.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Look at them,&rdquo; she said, and held them up for
them to see. &ldquo;Look at this old black coat and
skirt; do you see how threadbare and old-fashioned it
is? It isn&rsquo;t even very clean. And this horrible hat,&rdquo;
she pointed to a battered straw, &ldquo;it is almost in
pieces; and the boots are, quite. Her underclothes
were of such coarse, stiff calico that you would take
them for workhouse things, and all darned and mended
till you could hardly see the original stuff. The
stockings weren&rsquo;t even mended. They were just one
large hole. And there was no blouse under the coat at
all. Nothing but a chemise. How was one to imagine
that this was the young lady who was being inquired
for? There&rsquo;s a tremendous amount in appearances,
and she appeared to be the poorest of the
poor.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Gimblet seized upon the miserable garments and
examined them eagerly. But they rendered him no
information. Nothing was marked, the boots were
odd ones and of a prehistoric age; there was no
distinctive feature about any of the things.</p>

<p>With injunctions that they should be telephoned to
if Miss Turner awoke to consciousness, they left the
hospital and dismissed Am√©lie, who went back to
Grosvenor Street to pack and return to the hospital
with some of Barbara&rsquo;s belongings, so that she might
find them there if they were needed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now what I want is to see the constable who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
brought that young lady into the hospital,&rdquo; Gimblet
said to Jennins.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So do I,&rdquo; said the inspector. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s been sent for
and should be at the Yard by now,&rdquo; and they drove off
in another taxi.</p>

<p>Police-Constable Matterson of S division had already
arrived, and was awaiting them when they reached
Scotland Yard. Jennins called him into his private
office, and there, in response to their questions, he told
his story.</p>

<p>&ldquo;At about 2 a.m. on Wednesday morning,&rdquo; said he,
&ldquo;it being a dark, wet night, with the rain pouring down
like water out of a bucket, and the thunder claps as
near overhead, and as frequent, as ever I heard, I was
on duty near St. Mark&rsquo;s Church just outside Regent&rsquo;s
Park. There is a small bridge for foot passengers
across the canal opposite and I crossed it on my way to
the outer circle of the Park. I was just resting a
minute on the bridge, for I didn&rsquo;t like to stay under the
trees more than I need with that storm so close, when
a flash of lightning that must have been almost over
me, it was that bright, showed up the canal below, as I
leant on the parapet, so clear that I could have counted
every blade of grass. There was the canal winding out
of sight, and the surface of it all jumping and hissing as
the rain-drops hit it; and there were the banks on either
side and the trunks of the trees lit up as light as day.
But the thing that caught my eye was the sight of two
people struggling on the bank, a few yards from the
water. It was a man and a woman, and he seemed to
be trying to catch hold of her round the neck, while
she was dodging and defending herself as best she
could. It was all very clear for half a second and then
the dark swallowed everything up again, and the
thunder burst, as it seemed, just on my head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Apart from what I had seen it seemed to me that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
folks wouldn&rsquo;t be out for any good in that weather, and
at that hour and place; and when the noise of the clap
rumbled away I caught the sound of the tail end of a
scream which made me sure of it. I turned my
lantern towards the place and hollered back, running
to get over the fence and down to the canal as I did so.</p>

<p>&ldquo;As I came near to where I&rsquo;d seen the pair, two
successive flashes coming close one after the other
showed them up again no more than a few yards away,
and they saw me in the same instant. The man had
got a great spade in his hand, and when he caught sight
of me he lifted it up sideways and aimed a fearful blow
at the woman with the edge of it. She ducked and
dodged again&mdash;very active she was, poor thing&mdash;and
he missed, so that the blade glanced off her shoulder
and he as near as possible lost his balance. But he
recovered himself at once and threw up his arms again
with the spade clutched in both hands, as I saw by the
second flash, and brought it down with all his force
flat on the top of her head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t see her go down, for the light went before
the blow had fallen, and in the dark I lost him, and he
got clear away.</p>

<p>&ldquo;While I was groping about with my lantern, I fell
over the body of the girl, lying where he had struck
her to the ground, and at the first start off I thought he
had done for her sure enough. So I let her lie for a
few minutes, while I blew my whistle and kept on
searching around for the scoundrel. Two more of our
men came up after a time and we had a regular hunt,
but he&rsquo;d got a good start and we never saw him. On
turning our attention to the girl again, we found that
she was still alive, though unconscious, so we got an
ambulance and took her to the hospital. There was
nothing to show who she was, but from her clothes I
judged her to be one of the lowest and poorest class. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
reported the occurrence at the time, and made a further
search by daylight on the spot. I picked up the spade
near by, where the fellow had evidently dropped it as
he ran; it had a piece of stout cord attached to the
handle about four or five feet long, but was otherwise
without distinguishing mark of any kind. It&rsquo;s outside,
if you wish to see it, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Jennins told him to bring it in.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; he said to Gimblet, &ldquo;no one ever
thought of connecting this story of violence and
brutality with the two missing ladies. The report
didn&rsquo;t come my way, as it happens, but I don&rsquo;t suppose
for a moment I should have been a scrap the wiser if it
had. Still, it makes one feel a bit foolish now, I&rsquo;ll
own.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Matterson returned with the spade and cord, which
proved to be very ordinary; and Gimblet&rsquo;s inquiring
lens could discover nothing about them in any way
remarkable.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What was the man like?&rdquo; he asked the policeman.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t have much time to take notice, sir,&rdquo; replied
Matterson, &ldquo;but he was a dark fellow with a black
beard, and tall.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you see if he wore gloves?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come to think of it, now you ask me, sir, I believe
he did. I saw his hands plain enough as he lifted the
spade, and I ought to know. But I couldn&rsquo;t swear to it,
I&rsquo;m afraid, though my impression is that he did, and
that it struck me as curious at the time, in the sort of
way a thing will strike you for a moment and then slip
out of your memory like a dream does.&rdquo;</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXI" id="CHAPTER_XXI">CHAPTER XXI</a></h2>


<p>&ldquo;I bet it&rsquo;s our man,&rdquo; said Gimblet, as Jennins
dismissed the constable.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, he must have altered his appearance
if he is Mr. West, the gentleman from South America,
unless Matterson&rsquo;s account is very wrong indeed,&rdquo; was
Jennins&rsquo; only comment. &ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you going a bit out
of your way, Mr. Gimblet,&rdquo; he asked, &ldquo;to see any
connection between this violent attempt on Miss
Turner&rsquo;s life and the actual murder which has taken
place at 13 Scholefield Avenue? For my part I don&rsquo;t
see any reason to think the two affairs have anything
to do with each other. I admit it looked as if Miss
Turner and Mrs. Vanderstein had been in the house, but
surely that theory is disposed of now and it is clear
that your friend the actress was mistaken in thinking
it was them she saw. Remember, she didn&rsquo;t even know
them by sight, but merely guessed at their identity
from the description in the advertisement: two
ladies in white, one wearing a red cloak and the other
a mauve one. Why, there may have been dozens of
couples dressed in these colours going about London on
Monday, or any other night!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But the jewels,&rdquo; said Gimblet, &ldquo;she saw them too,
you know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Vanderstein hasn&rsquo;t a monopoly of diamonds.
And besides, at that distance, and at the pace Miss
Finner was going, she could only have received the
vaguest impression, in any case.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I suppose I have got my head full of Scholefield
Avenue,&rdquo; said Gimblet. &ldquo;I admit that I find it very
hard to remember that Mrs. Vanderstein, at all events,
is a very long way from that spot. And I daresay you
are right, and Miss Turner never was much nearer
to it. Still....&rdquo; Gimblet fell into an introspective
silence from which he soon roused himself with a
start. &ldquo;Tell me what you think, Jennins,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;Have you any theory?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t any theory about the Scholefield Avenue
business,&rdquo; replied Jennins reluctantly, &ldquo;but there
doesn&rsquo;t seem much mystery about the other affair, to
my way of thinking. Surely it is clear that when Mrs.
Vanderstein went off so secretly to Boulogne, for some
reason she wished it to appear that Miss Turner went
with her, while as a matter of fact the young lady
remained in London. Ten to one we shall find that
Mrs. Vanderstein had a more compromising companion
with her in France than she left in England. Miss
Turner, no doubt, retired to some secluded spot till
her presence should be again required, probably to
lodgings near Regent&rsquo;s Park. Very likely she stayed
indoors all day for fear of meeting acquaintances who
might call for troublesome explanations as to her
presence there, and being in want of exercise and fresh
air went for a walk at night in order to procure them.
Is it surprising that this ruffian of whom Matterson
caught a glimpse, meeting her at such an hour and in
so lonely a place, should not have spared her his
unwelcome advances? Matterson saw him trying to
put an arm round her neck, and it was very natural
for her to scream in such circumstances. On our man
running up, the black-bearded loafer, thinking himself
caught, struck out at the girl in a fit of temper, and then
took to his heels just in time to save himself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All very fine, Jennins,&rdquo; said Gimblet, &ldquo;but I can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
pick holes in that theory till you&rsquo;ll take it for a sieve.
To put aside the question whether such a young lady
as Miss Turner is said to be would lend herself to the
deception you suggest, is it conceivable that, if she did
go out to seek fresh air after dark, she should defer
doing so till two in the morning and then choose a
particularly violent thunderstorm to walk about in?
Would her desire for exercise have led her to stand
half way up the embankment of the canal when the
rain was falling in torrents, and had been doing so
since midnight? There is another thing as inexplicable,
and that is the attire in which she took this midnight
ramble. The clothes we saw at the hospital were
mere rags. It seems incredible that this young lady,
whom we know to have been clad on Monday night in
purple and fine linen, should have been going about on
Wednesday morning in garments which were not only
threadbare and indescribably ancient but actually
dirty. The battered state of the hat may be due to the
blow from the spade, and all the garments were of
course drenched by the rain, but there is something
beyond that in their repulsiveness. I can&rsquo;t imagine
how she can have brought herself to wear such things.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Apart from this behaviour of hers, which is in
itself a mystery, what was the black-bearded one
doing in the same place and hour and in the same
unpropitious conditions? They could hardly both
have been wandering there for the innocuous purpose
you attribute to Miss Turner. And, mark you, the
man was no destitute waif devoid of the means of
procuring himself shelter from the rain. He carried a
good serviceable spade which would have got him the
price of a night&rsquo;s lodging whenever he liked to pawn it.
Now the kind of rough you are thinking of does not
carry a spade or anything so suggestive of hard and
honest labour. On the other hand, who does use that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
implement in a town like this? A gardener might
have one, or a scavenger; or one or two other people.
I think one of the most likely, especially at night,
would be a gravedigger.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There you go!&rdquo; exclaimed Jennins; &ldquo;your mind is
running on bodies buried in the flower pots! I suppose
you think this fellow was going to bury the girl in one
of the beds in the park!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all very strange,&rdquo; mused Gimblet, unheeding
the inspector&rsquo;s jeering tones. &ldquo;The rope now. That
is a puzzle. What could he be going to do with a
rope? And why was it tied to a spade? Had he got
the thing in his hands when he was trying to put his
arms round Miss Turner&rsquo;s neck? It must have
hampered him a good deal and perhaps helped her to
avoid his clutches.&rdquo; Gimblet, with unseeing eyes,
stared fixedly at his companion, his mind busy with
the problem. Suddenly a light seemed to fall upon it.
&ldquo;By Jove!&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;I believe I see the whole
thing. If only Matterson were certain about the
gloves.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; asked Jennins eagerly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; said Gimblet. &ldquo;It is too wild an idea at
present, though indeed I do not think I can be
mistaken. But you have all the facts before you,
Jennins, and are as able to come to the right conclusion
as myself. I will leave you to think over the puzzle,
while I go back to my flat and see if the answer to the
wire I sent to Mrs. Vanderstein has yet arrived. It
ought to be there by now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But he found no telegram awaiting him. He was
annoyed and surprised at this, but the time taken by
foreign telegrams is always uncertain, and Mrs.
Vanderstein might have been out when his reached
Boulogne. Lunch was being kept warm for him, and he
made a hearty meal of Scotch woodcock and asparagus;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
with which he drank iced coffee and ate sponge cake
instead of bread. There were strawberries to finish up
with, and he left the dining-room with a peaceful smile
on his face.</p>

<p>It was three o&rsquo;clock, and the telegram was still
undelivered.</p>

<p>Gimblet decided to wait in for it, and, having now
leisure to think of others, rang up Sidney on the
telephone and told him of the discovery of Barbara
Turner&rsquo;s whereabouts.</p>

<p>Incoherent questions came to him over the wire, but
after a minute or two Sidney said &ldquo;good-bye&rdquo; and
rang off hastily. The detective smiled as he hung
up the receiver. In his mind&rsquo;s eye he saw the young
man dash out and drive swiftly in the direction of the
hospital, and indeed the picture his imagination drew
for him could not have been more accurate.</p>

<p>The afternoon passed and the evening wore away,
and yet no wire came from Mrs. Vanderstein. It was
tiresome, and Gimblet felt irritated with the lady for
her lack of courtesy. Surely she might have replied
by now. He felt that she held the clue to many things
which perplexed him, and he could not understand her
failure to give it to him. His own telegram had been
very urgent. Well, the police were sending a man to
see her; he was to go over by the 2.20 from Charing
Cross, and by now he would be arriving at Boulogne.
There could not be much more delay, telegram or no
telegram.</p>

<p>Gimblet gave up waiting and went out again. He
felt he must go to Scholefield Avenue once more. The
tragedy that had taken place there filled his thoughts;
and, being convinced in spite of Jennins&rsquo; contemptuous
incredulity that the two mysteries were in some
remote way connected, he was inclined to go and see
if there were not some trifling point about things at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
No.&nbsp;13 which he had overlooked, instead of waiting
longer for the minute glimmer of light which Mrs.
Vanderstein might be able to throw upon the darkness
with which the whole affair was enveloped.</p>

<p>Scholefield Avenue looked very quiet and peaceful
in the evening light; the few boys who still hovered
about the gate, survivals of the crowd which the
report of the murder had gathered there earlier in the
day, wore the tranquil air of those to whom time is no
object, and Gimblet, looking up and down the road,
where the shadows lay long and the air was cool in the
green twilight of the overhanging trees, thought again
what a good place the murderer had chosen for his
deed. Who would ever suspect evil in so calm and
bright an oasis among the mazes of dusty, traffic-worn
streets which surrounded it on every hand?</p>

<p>The house was in charge of a couple of policemen, who
let Gimblet in without demur when he showed them his
card, and followed him with their eyes with looks in
which curiosity and admiration were blended. He
went over the garden again, examining half-obliterated
footmarks, and poking about between flowering plants
lest something should be thrust away there and had
escaped his notice. Then into the house, where he
renewed his search, but without result. He looked
into the drawing-room again, where all was as he had
left it except that the body had been removed to a
bedroom, then went into the library and gazed again
at the dirty finger marks on the white paint of the
door. Whose fingers were they, he wondered, which
had left so many imprints? Was it the murdered
woman who had been shut up in that room? Had
Mrs. Vanderstein and her companion been there too,
or was Jennins right, and their presence in that vicinity
on Monday night been a figment of Miss Finner&rsquo;s excited
imagination?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span></p>

<p>His thoughts reverted to the powder puff and the
forged note, and he took the folded paper from his
pocket book and sniffed at it again. The odour of
scent, now faint indeed, but still clinging sweetly to
the impassioned words, was unmistakably that which
hovered about the house in Grosvenor Street. Arome
de la Corse, it was called, he remembered, and Am√©lie
had said that Mrs. Vanderstein had it sent to her
direct from Paris. Such extraordinary things happen
every day that anything short of a miracle hardly
attracts attention, but surely it would be a strain on the
long arm of coincidence to suppose that, having
strayed on to the scene of a murder owing to the
mistaken idea that he was on the track of Mrs. Vanderstein,
he should then find that not only did the dead
woman resemble that lady and wear similar clothes
but that she even used the same uncommon perfume!
Gimblet&rsquo;s whole soul revolted at such an impossibility.
In the name of common sense, he said to himself, it
must be Mrs. Vanderstein who had been seen on the
doorstep on Monday night, and none other, in spite of
all probability to the contrary; though what she was
doing in that <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">gal√®re</i> certainly seemed incomprehensible
from nearly every point of view.</p>

<p>No contingency was ever dismissed by Gimblet as
too wild for consideration, and the only reasonable
explanation of her presence, he felt, was that she was in
some way mixed up with the murder, an accomplice at
least, if not the actual author of the deed; but this
view involved so complete a shifting of ideas, that he
put it aside for further consideration in the light of the
information which the man sent by Scotland Yard to
Boulogne might be able to furnish. If only the walls
could speak! he thought, as he finally realised that
nothing more was to be gathered, and, before leaving
the room, strolled over to the mantelpiece in order to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
have a nearer look at the picture which hung there, and
which he had noticed the day before.</p>

<p>It was a small oil painting, dark with dirt and age,
and much of the detail lost in a general blackness.
Still the figures, those of a man in blue and another in
greenish brown in the act of lighting a long pipe, could
be clearly enough distinguished, together with enough
of the background to make it plain that this represented
an interior. Gimblet studied it with the keenest
appreciation; it was just the class of picture he most
delighted in. A longing took him to remove it from its
nail and carry it to the light, and with rather a guilty
glance back at the door, which he had, however, shut
as he entered, he put up his hand and lifted it
off.</p>

<p>As he delicately lowered his prize he caught sight of
something which made him very nearly drop it.</p>

<p>On the square of wall paper which had been hidden
by the picture was some pencilled writing, scrawled
irregularly in a large round hand:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>&ldquo;I am locked in this room. I write this hoping it
may be the means of delivering these people to justice,
for I am sure they intend no good. I can see that by
the fact that the man with the black beard has
promised to help me to escape. Why should there be
need to escape? But I do not believe he will keep his
word. I have been here so long, I do not know how
long, but many hours, perhaps days, and God knows
what dreadful thing they are doing in the drawing-room
to Mr&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<p>The writing broke off abruptly about half way down
the square of darker colour, where the paper had been
prevented from fading by the protecting picture.
Gimblet gazed at it with all the emotions of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
scientist whose theory has stood the decisive test.
His hands fumbled in his excitement, as he hastily
snatched out his notebook, and sought in it for the
telegraph form Higgs had obtained from the Piccadilly
office. He flattened it against the wall below the
pencilled words, more in order to gloat over this proof
of the soundness of his deductions than for the sake of
comparing the two handwritings, for it had only
needed the first glance to make it plain to him that
they were one and the same. The writing on the wall
was larger; the letters followed each other unevenly,
and while some of the lines drooped lower and lower
as they advanced, others rose crookedly to meet them,
so that one or two actually overlapped and were rather
hard to decipher, but the essential character of the
hand was clearly identical with that of the telegram.
There was no mistaking the slant of the short line of
the h&rsquo;s or the oval converging lines of the w&rsquo;s and the
low crossing of the t&rsquo;s, besides a hundred other small
points which left the trained eye in no doubt as to the
authorship of the message.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wonder what Jennins will say to this,&rdquo; thought
Gimblet, as he copied down the words on a page of his
notebook. &ldquo;That Scholefield Avenue has got on my
brain, I suppose.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Excited as he was, he did not forget his original
purpose in taking down the painting, but carried it to
the window and examined it closely by the now
diminishing light. On nearer inspection it proved to
be of less interest than he had expected, and he hung
it up again with the less regret.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But even Jennins will have to admit that a leaning
towards Art comes in very useful sometimes,&rdquo; he
thought, as he once more hid the scrawled message
from view.</p>

<p>It was long past eight when the detective returned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
to his flat, only to find that there was still no answer
to his telegram to Boulogne.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothing has come and no one has been to see us
since you went out, sir,&rdquo; Higgs told him.</p>

<p>Higgs always spoke of himself as &ldquo;us&rdquo; when he
was engaged on Gimblet&rsquo;s affairs, just as he alluded,
with a fine impartiality, to matters in which his master
alone was concerned as &ldquo;ours.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ve been ringing us up from the Yard,&rdquo; he
went on, &ldquo;been ringing every few minutes for the last
half-hour, and said I was to ask you to speak to them
on the telephone the minute you come in. There they
go again,&rdquo; he concluded, as the bell tinkled violently
in the library at the same moment as there came a
ring at the front door.</p>

<p>Gimblet hurried to the instrument and Higgs went
to answer the door.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you there?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, is that Mr. Gimblet? Hold the line, please,
sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In a moment Jennins&rsquo; voice sounded in his ear.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Gimblet, that you? Oh, Mr. Gimblet, our
man has wired from Boulogne and it appears that
things have taken a very unexpected turn. I daresay
you&rsquo;ve seen an evening paper?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Gimblet had heard so much when the library door
burst open, and Sir Gregory rushed into the room.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Look at this,&rdquo; he almost screamed, evidently
beside himself with some painful emotion. &ldquo;Look at
this!&rdquo;</p>

<p>He waved an evening paper.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, do go away, Sir Gregory,&rdquo; said Gimblet;
&ldquo;can&rsquo;t you see I&rsquo;m busy? Hullo, Jennins! Jennins,
are you there?&rdquo;</p>

<p>But Sir Gregory would not be denied. Seizing
Gimblet&rsquo;s arm he tore him away from the telephone,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
and holding the newspaper under his eyes pointed to it
with a shaking hand. He would have spoken, but
sobs choked his utterance, and, glancing at him for the
first time and in no very friendly humour, Gimblet
was surprised to see that tears were rolling down the
kindly pink face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, what&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo; he said, but Sir
Gregory only pointed to the unfolded sheet. The
detective&rsquo;s eyes at last followed the outstretched
finger, and he read:</p>

<p class="hd1">&ldquo;Murder of Mrs. Vanderstein.</p>

<p class="hd2">&ldquo;Missing Lady Found Dead in Her Hotel at Boulogne.&rdquo;</p>

<hr class="l1" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXII" id="CHAPTER_XXII">CHAPTER XXII</a></h2>


<p>&ldquo;What do you think about going over to
Boulogne, Mr. Gimblet?&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was the following morning, and
Jennins was sitting in Gimblet&rsquo;s rooms. He had come
round to talk matters over and discuss plans and
methods of carrying them out.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think I may be more useful if I stay here,&rdquo;
Gimblet said, in answer to his question. &ldquo;Your
fellow, Burford, who is over there, is a good sound man
who will, at least, not overlook the obvious, and Bonnot,
the French detective, who is said to have been
summoned, is a master of his profession. These
murders are certainly the work of the same gang, and
it may be easier to trace them here in London, if it is,
as it appears to be, their starting point, than it will be
to do so in a foreign country. There is no more news
from Burford, I suppose?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothing new since last night. And no more than
the papers have, anyhow. These reporters are the
deuce.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They are,&rdquo; Gimblet agreed. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s see again
what they say about it.&rdquo; He took up a paper, turned
to the sinister headline, and read aloud:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>&ldquo;A startling sequel has followed the mysterious
disappearance of Mrs. Vanderstein and Miss Turner,
who left their home early in the week and whose
whereabouts were only yesterday discovered. One<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
of these ladies, Mrs. Vanderstein, who, it will be remembered,
we ascertained to be staying at Boulogne, was
found dead in her room at the H√¥tel de Douvres
yesterday afternoon, and foul play is strongly suspected.
Traces of violence were plainly to be seen and
it is thought likely that the poor lady was strangled to
death. A curious feature of the affair is that though
Mrs. Vanderstein had with her a large quantity of her
valuable jewellery, some of which was actually lying
on the table at the time, so far as is at present known
none of it has been stolen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A page in the service of the hotel reports that he
showed a visitor to Mrs. Vanderstein&rsquo;s room soon after
luncheon, and this stranger, who is described as a tall
man with a black beard, left the hotel shortly before
three o&rsquo;clock, after delivering a message from the lady
to the effect that she did not wish to be disturbed again
that day. The order was duly given to the domestics
of the hotel, and if a messenger from London had
not arrived by the five o&rsquo;clock boat on important
business and insisted on penetrating to Mrs. Vanderstein&rsquo;s
presence, it is probable that the murder would
not have been discovered until to-day. The authorities
are investigating the affair with the utmost energy,
and it is believed that they are on the track of the man
with the black beard.&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<p>Gimblet put down the paper. &ldquo;There are various
other paragraphs saying the same thing in different
words,&rdquo; he remarked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It certainly looks as if you were right again,&rdquo;
observed Jennins reflectively, &ldquo;about all this being
the work of the same gang, I mean.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s not a doubt of it,&rdquo; said Gimblet. &ldquo;I was
sure of it from the first, though I admit that I had not
much to go on. A mere whiff of perfume. Let us<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
see how much we know now. To go back to Monday
night, Mrs. Vanderstein and Miss Turner voluntarily
entered the house in Scholefield Avenue, though
whether in response to an invitation from the so-called
West or not we do not know, in spite of a theory I
have on the subject. They then presumably separated,
Miss Turner being imprisoned in the room on the
ground floor, very much against her will and to her
alarm since she broke a window in the hope of
escaping, and when that attempt failed wrote a despairing
message on the wall, in which she stated her fear
that something dreadful was being done to somebody
in the drawing-room. You will, I am sure,
agree with me that, though the message says that
her alarm was for &lsquo;Mr&rsquo; and then stops, an s would
have been added if Miss Turner had not been
interrupted, and it was her intention to write &lsquo;Mrs.&rsquo;
But whether this would have referred to the woman
who was buried in the flower stand or whether she was
thinking of her friend, Mrs. Vanderstein, is not clear.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Was Mrs. Vanderstein in the drawing-room at the
time of the murder, and if so what was her business
there, is the next question where our knowledge fails
us. We know she was in that room at some time or
other&mdash;I knew that the moment I smelt her perfume
on the powder puff and note&mdash;but whether or no she
was there at the moment of the crime we cannot
tell. In either case her subsequent proceedings are
extraordinary. If she was detained in the house
against her will and made her escape by some unknown
means, why did she fly to Boulogne, instead of to her
own house or to the nearest police station? Why,
when she got to Boulogne, did she not communicate
with her friends until yesterday? It is true she said
she had written previously, but it would have been
more natural if she had telegraphed, and if she received<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
no reply had telegraphed again. Why did she display
no anxiety on Miss Turner&rsquo;s account? Her actions
seem at present to be inexplicable and strange to the
last degree. Had she suddenly gone off her head?
That is the most probable solution, to my mind. If so,
it may well be that it was she who committed the
terrible crime I discovered in Scholefield Avenue, and
then, with the mixture of cunning and recklessness
common to lunatics of a criminal type, retired to
Boulogne to wait till the affair should have blown
over. There are, however, several drawbacks to such
a theory, and one of them is that it does not account
for the black-bearded man, unless he was a lover,
and indeed it seems most likely that he was.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t know what was the part he played on
Monday night. Perhaps he helped Mrs. Vanderstein
to escape more effectually than he did Miss Turner, in
spite of his promise to her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;All we know is that he took the girl out of the house
on Tuesday night or Wednesday morning and that
they went together to the bank of the canal in Regent&rsquo;s
Park, where Matterson came upon them. We know
that &lsquo;black-beard&rsquo; carried a heavy spade with him.
What for? Not to use it as he did, I think; neither
was it to dig a grave with after Miss Turner had been
disposed of in some other way. Think, Jennins, there
was a cord attached to the handle, and the canal was
within a few yards of them. Do those two facts
suggest nothing to you? Surely it is obvious that his
intention was to throw the young lady into the water,
having previously tied the spade to her so as to make
sure she would sink. No doubt she guessed what was
in his mind, and that was why Matterson saw her
defending herself, poor girl, and heard her scream.
Such at least is my opinion.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t wonder if you&rsquo;ve hit the nail on the head<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
this time,&rdquo; agreed the inspector. &ldquo;The question is,
what&rsquo;s the next thing to be done?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s high time I followed up a clue contained in the
letter purporting to come from Prince Felipe,&rdquo; replied
Gimblet. &ldquo;I should have done so long ago, if I had
not waited for Mrs. Vanderstein&rsquo;s version of the affair.
You remember a Madame Q. is mentioned as the bearer
of the note. Well, who is Madame Q.? I telegraphed
early yesterday to Mrs. Vanderstein saying, &lsquo;Were you
at 13 Scholefield Avenue on Monday night, and who
else was present? Letter has been found there
apparently addressed to you by Prince F. mentioning
Madame Q. Please wire very fully, and give Madame
Q.&rsquo;s full name and address. Very grave matters
involved.&rsquo; If the lady had replied to my wire we should
doubtless have been spared a lot of trouble, though we
might not have been able to save her life; but, as
things are, I propose to try and sift the question of
Madame Q.&rsquo;s identity for myself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Jennins went away; and Gimblet, after being detained
by a short visit from Sidney&mdash;who was on his
way to catch the eleven o&rsquo;clock train to Boulogne&mdash;also
took up his hat and left the house.</p>

<p>A quarter of an hour later he was standing on the
doorstep of Mrs. Vanderstein&rsquo;s Grosvenor Street house.</p>

<p>He found, as was natural, a shocked and dislocated
household. The cook and Blake were seated in the
morning-room, where the cook was flourishing a handkerchief,
and reiterating observations to the effect
that she had always known something terrible was
going to happen ever since the second footman had
broken the looking-glass in the pantry; while the young
man referred to was standing just outside the door,
and putting his head into the room every few minutes
to remark defiantly, though with a certain uneasiness,
that it wasn&rsquo;t in nature for so tremendous an event to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
be brought about by such an insignificant piece of
glass as the one he had had the &ldquo;misfortune&rdquo; with.
From the drawing-room came the penetrating shrillness
of Am√©lie&rsquo;s voice, apparently filling in the newspaper
account of the murder, with all the embellishing detail
an unshrinkingly gruesome imagination could suggest,
for the benefit of the rest of the maids, whose chorusing
groans could also be distinguished. But, on the whole,
there was more perturbation as to the effect the tragedy
would be likely to have on their own futures than distress
at the dreadful fate of their mistress; and
Gimblet, if he had to listen to much lamentation, found
himself also beset with many anxious questions.</p>

<p>It was some minutes before he was able to introduce
his own object in coming there; but at last he drew
Blake to one side, and asked him if Mrs. Vanderstein
had kept a visiting book with a list of the people she
called on.</p>

<p>She had done so, and it was produced, but to
Gimblet&rsquo;s disappointment contained no name beginning
with the letter Q. There were, however, the names of
two or three French ladies, and he wondered whether
Q were merely a cipher for Gerady or Kerigoet. Blake,
cross-questioned, could think of no foreign lady with
whom Mrs. Vanderstein was on familiar terms.</p>

<p>Gimblet remembered Am√©lie&rsquo;s thorough knowledge
in the matter of her mistress&rsquo; correspondence, and
called to her to come and speak to him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Had Mrs. Vanderstein a friend of your nationality?&rdquo;
he asked. &ldquo;Was there any French lady whom
she knew well, and whose name, perhaps, began with
a Q?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A lady? No,&rdquo; said Am√©lie. &ldquo;A friend? Hardly!
Il ne manquait plus que cela! But she was acquainted
with a French woman, whose name begins with Q.
Without doubt, it is of that Justine you speak.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Justine?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Eh! Yes. Justine Querterot. Madame Querterot,
as she calls herself, though, for me, I never saw that
she had a husband. It is said that he shot himself, the
poor man, and I do not see what he could have done
better with a wife like that one! Ah, monsieur, a
nasty, bad woman!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There are people like that,&rdquo; Gimblet agreed diplomatically;
&ldquo;but tell me, how did Mrs. Vanderstein
know this Madame Querterot?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She came for a time to <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">coiffer</i> Madame, and to
rejuvenate her complexion, which needed nothing of
the kind, I assure you. But she had the idea to be
massaged, and for some months that woman was daily
in the house. Never did I comprehend how Mrs.
Vanderstein could tolerate her. A woman so vulgar,
so familiar, and who never ceased to talk and talk and
talk!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Am√©lie spoke with virtuous indignation, as one to
whom the gift of silence has been vouchsafed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She is a masseuse, then?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not a real masseuse, though so she calls herself;
but, to say the truth, she is just a hairdresser who tries
to make people believe she knows something of the
care of the skin. For some reason she appeared to
amuse Madame, and I think it was chiefly for that
reason that she let her come.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did she come every day, and has she been here
since Mrs. Vanderstein left home?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;For two or three months she came every day,&rdquo;
replied Am√©lie bitterly. &ldquo;Indeed I thought she was
coming always, but only last Monday&mdash;the very day
Madame went away&mdash;I heard la Justine say that it
was her final visit; and, in truth, she has not been here
since, I am very happy to say it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; said Gimblet. &ldquo;Well, I shall have to go and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
see her. Let me see, you said she is a tall, dark
woman, did you not?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But no,&rdquo; cried Am√©lie, &ldquo;on the contrary she
is short, and has yellow hair in the worst possible
taste.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What makes you dislike this woman so much?
Do you know anything against her, by any chance?&rdquo;</p>

<p>But it appeared that Am√©lie knew nothing against
Madame Querterot. Vague accusations and dark
charges of a general character were all she had to
bring; and, after listening to a tirade of this kind for
a considerable time, Gimblet cut it short by asking
for the masseuse&rsquo;s address.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your mistress left a letter for her,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;which
has been sent over to us by the French police. It is
of no importance, and contains, I think, only a reference
to Madame Querterot&rsquo;s account, but I am anxious
to deliver it; and, as the poor lady had got no further
with the address than Madame Q, without your
assistance it would have been a matter of some
difficulty.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was unfortunate that the detective should have hit
upon this excuse to explain his interrogations, for the
idea that even death had not put a stop to intercourse
between Mrs. Vanderstein and her enemy nearly suffocated
Am√©lie, whose jealous suspicions woke again at
the challenge.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is the address, monsieur,&rdquo; she said, as she
gave it to him, &ldquo;but I would not count on finding the
bird in the nest. It is in the neighbourhood of Boulogne
that you should look for that infamous woman. One
of her kind is capable of everything; and, in my
opinion, nothing is more probable than that it is she
who is the real assassin of my poor Madame! A
black beard, indeed! Is she not a hairdresser?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Gimblet fled before the storm of words he had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
provoked, and hurried to the Pimlico address that
he had obtained.</p>

<p>In spite of himself, Am√©lie&rsquo;s words echoed in his ears:
&ldquo;Is she not a hairdresser?&rdquo; A black beard was a
simple enough disguise, and fair hair may be covered.
But he had been told also that the masseuse was a
short woman, and height is not so easily simulated.
Such were his thoughts as he turned the handle of the
shop door.</p>

<p>There was no one inside, and Gimblet had time to
remark the empty shelves and forlorn look of the
window&mdash;which the waxen lady no longer graced with
her presence&mdash;before, in answer to the rapping of his
hand on the counter and his repeated cry of &ldquo;Shop,
please,&rdquo; the door leading to the back room opened and
Julie Querterot made her appearance.</p>

<p>It was a sad enough figure she presented to him that
day: paler, thinner, more tired-looking than ever.
There was a scared look in her eyes now, and black
lines under them. She came forward slowly, almost
timidly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you want anything?&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I am afraid
our stock is nearly all&mdash;sold out.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thanks,&rdquo; said Gimblet. &ldquo;I called to see Madame
Querterot&mdash;is it possible that I am speaking to
her?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh no,&rdquo; said Julie with a little smile. &ldquo;I am her
daughter. But I fear you cannot see my mother just
now. She is&mdash;out.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Never mind,&rdquo; returned Gimblet. &ldquo;I will wait.
Perhaps she will be in by luncheon-time? I have a
message for her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do not know when she will be back,&rdquo; said the
girl. &ldquo;Can you not leave the message with me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is for her own ear,&rdquo; said Gimblet. &ldquo;If you
don&rsquo;t mind, I will wait a little.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span></p>

<p>He sat down as he spoke, and Julie, after a hesitating
glance, went back to the inner room, leaving the door
ajar between the two.</p>

<p>Gimblet, left to himself, was surprised to notice
again how very few were the articles exposed for sale.
Bare as the shop had looked when he first entered, he
now saw it to be even emptier than he had thought.
A tradesman&rsquo;s almanack on one wall, a picture from
an illustrated paper on the other, two or three bottles
of hair-wash and a few packets of hair-pins seemed to
constitute the whole stock in trade.</p>

<p>Gimblet was still wondering whether the massage
was in as bad a way as the hairdressing side of the
Querterot business, when a subdued sound coming
from the next room drew his attention.</p>

<p>What was it, that sort of low, muffled panting?</p>

<p>The detective got up softly, and stole to the
door.</p>

<p>Peeping shamelessly through the crack, he saw that
a chair had been drawn up to the table and that Julie
sat there with her head bent and resting on her hands.
It was from her that the sound came which had caught
his ear, for her whole body was shaking with the sobs
which she tried in vain to stifle.</p>

<p>Gimblet opened the door and passed boldly through.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am so sorry,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;to have come at a
time when you are unhappy. But won&rsquo;t you tell
me all about it? Who knows, I may be able to help
you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At sight of him the girl started up, with a renewed
effort to get the better of her grief; but the kind tone
of Gimblet&rsquo;s voice put the finishing touch to her
emotions: losing all attempt at self-control, she laid
her head down on the table before her and gave way
to unrestrained and passionate tears.</p>

<p>Gimblet let her weep for a while, then he sat down<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
near her and tried to comfort her. He took one of
her hands and patted it gently, as if she had been a
child.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There, there,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t cry any more. Tell
me what&rsquo;s the matter and let&rsquo;s see if something can&rsquo;t
be done about it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Gradually her tears came more slowly; the convulsive
sobs that had shaken her died away, and she
sat up and dried her eyes, looking at him from time to
time with furtive shyness.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are very kind, sir,&rdquo; she said at last, succumbing
reluctantly to that feeling of confidence which
Gimblet always succeeded in inspiring if he tried.
&ldquo;It was&mdash;it was only because you asked to see my
mother.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How&rsquo;s that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She&mdash;she&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know where she is.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No? But never mind. You will hear where she
has been when she comes home.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t understand. She hasn&rsquo;t been home for
four days, and I have no idea when she is coming back.
She did not tell me anything.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dear me!&rdquo; Gimblet looked grave. &ldquo;When do
you say you saw her last?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was on Tuesday morning,&rdquo; said Julie. &ldquo;She
came and woke me very early; she seemed to have been
out, for she still wore her hat, and in her hand she had
a black bag. After that she went away. I heard her
moving about for some time, till at last she went downstairs
and I heard the front door slam. I jumped
out of bed and looked out of the window and saw her
going down the street with a big bag in each hand.
And I haven&rsquo;t seen or heard anything of her since.
But I am sure, oh, I <em>know</em> she did not mean to come
back!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How do you know that?&rdquo; Gimblet asked.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I know it from what she said, and from what she
did, before she went.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you tell me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Julie looked at him doubtfully.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bert&mdash;that is a friend of mine&mdash;tried to make me
promise not to say anything about it, but I told him
I should go to the police if I didn&rsquo;t hear soon. And
I feel I must tell some one, for something dreadful
may have happened to her,&rdquo; Julie added, half to
herself. &ldquo;Have you anything to do with the police?&rdquo;
she asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, yes, I have, as a matter of fact; in an
indirect way.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You will know what to do then, if I tell you. Bert
doesn&rsquo;t seem to know what to do; he only rages.
Well, I think my mother has gone away for good,
because, before she went, she got a man to come to the
house and buy nearly every portable thing in it.
There is hardly anything left besides these chairs and
table, and my bed upstairs. Soon after she had gone
they came and took away the things.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did she leave you no money?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, but she left me the house, you see; only the
rent is due and I have nothing to pay it with. And
she told me to collect any bills that were due for her
services, and that she made me a present of the money.
So when she was gone I looked in the ledger and found
that everything owing to her had been paid up during
the last few days, except one account. It was that of
Mrs. Vanderstein, the poor lady who was murdered
at Boulogne yesterday, as perhaps you have seen in the
papers?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Gimblet inclined his head gravely, and she went on.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My mother used to go to massage the complexion
of Mrs. Vanderstein, and the amount owing was large,
over twenty pounds. I was grateful that such a sum<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
should be given to me; but, when I saw the next
morning that the lady had disappeared, I made sure
it was because she was unable to pay her bills, and it
seemed likely that my mother had known this when
she was so generous to me. I made sure I should never
see a penny of that money, and I was in despair, as
I didn&rsquo;t know what to do about the rent, or even how
to live in the meantime. I went up to Mrs. Vanderstein&rsquo;s
house to see if she had really gone, and a kind
old gentleman told me the bill would be paid all the
same. That was a great comfort, but I knew it would
not be for some time, at any rate, and perhaps not till
I was starving. It did not really matter so very
much,&rdquo; Julie added loyally, &ldquo;for I am anxious to
enter a religious sisterhood, and they will take me, I
am sure, even if I have nothing to bring them. But I
can&rsquo;t bear to go to them as a beggar, and I wish, I
wish she hadn&rsquo;t left me quite destitute without any
warning,&rdquo; she concluded, her eyes filling with tears
again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then what did she wake you up to say, early on
Tuesday morning?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I told you she had a bag in her hand? She took
some clothes out of it and gave them to me. She told
me to burn them and that she would explain why
when she came back. But she said I might keep the
linings to make myself petticoats. Such fine petticoats
would be no use to me. Still, it was kind of her.
And then she took out this and gave it to me to take
care of&rdquo;&mdash;Julie put her hand to her neck and pulled
out from under her blouse a long string of enormous
pearls. &ldquo;She said that one of her customers had asked
her to look after them while she was travelling,&rdquo; continued
the girl, lifting the necklace over her head
and holding it out to Gimblet. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know if
they are real, though she told me to be very careful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
of them and to wear them always. But I think if they
had been real she would not have left them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Gimblet took the necklace without a word. He
was for the moment incapable of speaking.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That was all my mother said to me,&rdquo; went on
Julie, &ldquo;but she seemed very pleased about something;
and at the same time excited. When I looked out of
the window and saw her walking away, she was wearing
clothes I had never seen before; they must have
been quite new. They were simple, certainly, just a
coat and skirt and a small hat; but they were beautifully
made and fitted her so well, not at all like what
she generally wore. There is something about expensive
clothes that makes people look so different.
I should hardly have known her if it had not been for
a way she has of walking. I could only see the top of
her head, but the hat was a very smart one, with a
beautiful osprey in it. Somehow she had the air of a
person going to a wedding, and I can&rsquo;t help thinking
that perhaps it was her own wedding she was going to.
She may have married some one above us in station
and not have wanted him to know of my existence.
That is what I think, but Bert says not.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Gimblet cleared his throat. &ldquo;I wonder,&rdquo; he said,
&ldquo;if you would mind showing me the clothes you spoke
of that your mother gave you before she left.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid I can&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Julie. &ldquo;I&mdash;you see I
had no money&mdash;I sold them to a second-hand clothes
shop in Victoria Street. Bert wanted to see them too.
He thinks my mother must have had some special
reason for saying they were to be burnt, but I don&rsquo;t
believe she would have told me I could keep the linings
if they had been infectious.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What were they like?&rdquo; Gimblet asked. It needed
all his self-control to keep the eagerness out of his
voice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Two beautiful white evening dresses,&rdquo; said Julie,
&ldquo;and two opera cloaks of red and mauve silk all
covered with lovely embroidery and lace. Of course
I could never have worn them and it seemed a pity
to cut them up. I simply couldn&rsquo;t have burned them.
The shop only gave me five pounds for the lot, but
that will keep me for some time till I have decided
what to do. Still, Bert says I ought not to have sold
them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;By the way,&rdquo; said Gimblet, &ldquo;who is Bert?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The girl flushed. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s just a boy I know,&rdquo; she
said. &ldquo;He used to go to school with me, and he is
always good to me. I shouldn&rsquo;t like to annoy him or
to hurt his feelings, and I ought not to have spoken
of him, because when he advised me not to go to the
police, and I wouldn&rsquo;t promise, he said that I should
see that harm would come of it. And so I told him
that if my mother came back and blamed me for having
spoken of her absence, as he seems to think she would,
I would say that he had urged me not to. And then
he got quite angry and told me to do as I pleased, but
not to mix him up in it, and so I said of course I&rsquo;d
never mention his name if he didn&rsquo;t like; but now I&rsquo;ve
done it.&rdquo; She stopped, breathless.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, give Bert a message from me,&rdquo; said Gimblet;
&ldquo;tell him I agree with him so far, and think you have
no need to go to the police yet awhile. But you had
better not tell him I have anything to do with them,
as he seems to dislike them so much. Shall you see
him soon?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I expect he will come this evening when he
leaves off work; he generally does. And I think I
shan&rsquo;t tell him anything about you. Really, it isn&rsquo;t
his business and I don&rsquo;t like being always lectured.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think you are quite right,&rdquo; said Gimblet. &ldquo;Now
one question. Have you any idea as to the man with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
whom you think your mother may have gone off?
Had you any suspicion before that she was thinking
of marrying again?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The girl hesitated a moment. &ldquo;No,&rdquo; she said,
&ldquo;I have no idea at all who it could be.&rdquo;</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXIII" id="CHAPTER_XXIII">CHAPTER XXIII</a></h2>


<p class="cap"><span class="upper">Gimblet</span> was late for the inquest, which had
been fixed for two o&rsquo;clock. By the time
he arrived the evidence of Higgs and the
policeman he had fetched, and that of Brampton, the
artist, and the house agents&rsquo; clerk had been already
taken, and there only remained his own and the doctor&rsquo;s
to be heard.</p>

<p>Nothing new was brought to light, and the jury returned
a verdict of &ldquo;Wilful murder against some person
or persons unknown.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Gimblet did not judge it expedient to disclose the
theories he had formed on the subject of the crime.
As he walked away from the house in the company of
Jennins, whom he had found there when he arrived,
the inspector said to him:</p>

<p>&ldquo;An old-clothes dealer in Victoria Street has communicated
with us. They have bought what they
think, from the published description, to be the dresses
and cloaks worn by Mrs. Vanderstein and Miss Turner
on Monday night. I am going to get that French maid
of theirs to go down to the place with me and see if
the people are right in their assumption. They say
they bought the things from a young woman who gave
an address in Pimlico and the name of Julie Querterot.
Can she be the Madame Q. of the note? If she is, it
is strange that she should not give a false name; but
everything about this case is mysterious.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is not she,&rdquo; said Gimblet, &ldquo;it was her mother.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
I have just been to their house and seen her. As for
mysteries, there is only one left as far as I am concerned,
and that is the whereabouts of West, and the question
whether he has not by this time exchanged his disguise
of a black beard for another in which it will be
harder to identify him. Everything else, I think, is
quite clear, with the exception of a few trifling details,
and I do not think it will be long before we may hope
to lay our hands on Mr. West himself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Gimblet refused, however, to impart his lately
acquired information to Jennins, telling him, much to
the inspector&rsquo;s disgust, that he would know all
about it soon enough.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And a tangled web you&rsquo;ll find it, Jennins,&rdquo; said
he.</p>

<p>They were interrupted by a messenger, who informed
Jennins that Miss Turner was conscious and anxious
to make a statement.</p>

<p>Gimblet and the inspector went together to the
hospital, where they found Barbara looking very much
better than the day before. She was recovering wonderfully,
they were told, but must not excite herself
more than could be avoided. Indeed, she would
not have been allowed to see them yet, if she had not
been fretting so much to tell her story that it was
thought best to let her do it. She must not, however,
be made aware of the death of her friend if it were
possible to conceal it from her for the next few days.</p>

<p>She greeted the two men with a feeble smile. &ldquo;I
hear that I was rescued by one of your men,&rdquo; she said
to Jennins, &ldquo;and I am more grateful to him than I can
say, though I do not remember very much after I
realised that that man was trying to tie his spade round
my neck.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s lucky you were seen in time,&rdquo; replied Jennins.
&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t want to bother you to-day, but at the same<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
time we are, of course, anxious to hear anything you
can tell us about the scoundrel you were with.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I want to tell you all about it so that you may
be able to catch him&mdash;and the woman too. I suppose
you haven&rsquo;t got them yet?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Jennins shook his head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I thought perhaps Mrs. Vanderstein had been
able to put you on the track. How glad I am that she
escaped. I was afraid&mdash;but no matter now. Has
she told you how she managed to get away?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Vanderstein went abroad immediately,&rdquo; said
Gimblet evasively; &ldquo;we have not heard any details
from her yet. But will you not tell us your adventures
from the beginning? How was it you found yourselves
in Scholefield Avenue?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Barbara looked at him blankly. &ldquo;Scholefield
Avenue,&rdquo; she repeated, &ldquo;where is that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The house in which you were imprisoned is there,&rdquo;
said Gimblet; &ldquo;have you forgotten? You went there
with Mrs. Vanderstein on Monday night after the
opera. I want you to tell us why you went to it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know where it was,&rdquo; said Barbara, &ldquo;but
I don&rsquo;t think I can tell you why we went. I don&rsquo;t
think Mrs. Vanderstein would like me to do that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;As you wish,&rdquo; replied Gimblet; &ldquo;but this will
show you that I already know something of your
friend&rsquo;s private affairs.&rdquo; He took out the sheet of
notepaper bearing the arms of Targona, and handed
it to her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She gave you this!&rdquo; cried the girl, and as Gimblet
remained silent: &ldquo;Then she cannot mind my speaking
of it. Yes, it is true that we went to that house to
meet Prince Felipe, but I don&rsquo;t know if he came there
or not.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, he did not go.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then the whole thing was false! I thought so at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
the beginning, but afterwards I was not sure. It was
on Monday morning that Mrs. Vanderstein spoke to
me about it. For a week she had been looking strange:
excited, pleased&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know what exactly&mdash;happier,
younger, somehow different from her usual look. And
on Monday she came to my room and told me, blushing
and smiling, that it was her happiness to be loved by
Prince Felipe of Targona, and that in all probability
she was going to marry him. They had only seen each
other in the distance, she said, but it had been love
at first sight for both of them, and she was so happy,
so happy! And wouldn&rsquo;t I say I was glad? I asked
her how she knew what he felt for her, if they had never
met, and she said she had had letters from him and had
written to him herself, and that she was going to meet
him that very night after the opera, at the house of a
friend of his. She said they could not meet in public,
or at his hotel, or in her own home, as he was surrounded
by his suite, and his mother, who was also with him,
watched his every movement, so that all his comings
and goings were seen and marked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They were staying at Fianti&rsquo;s Hotel just opposite
to us in Grosvenor Street, you know, so it would have
been rather difficult for the Prince to come to our
house without being noticed. It was intended that he
should marry for political reasons, and at any sign
of his affections being bestowed on a private individual
an outcry would have been raised, which would have
been hard to ignore. It was Prince Felipe&rsquo;s plan, so
Mrs. Vanderstein told me, that they should be married
quietly and that he should then abdicate; to which
less objection would be made when it was known that
he was irretrievably disposed of from a matrimonial
point of view. The whole story appeared to me so
improbable and fantastic that I couldn&rsquo;t help laughing
at it, which offended my friend very much, and in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
order to convince me she finally showed me some of the
Prince&rsquo;s letters, including the one you have there. I
could not doubt any longer after I had seen them,
though I was surprised and, I must say, shocked to
hear that the go-between in the affair and the bearer
of all the notes was a Frenchwoman, a hairdresser
employed by Mrs. Vanderstein, and also, it seemed, by
one of the suite of Prince Felipe.</p>

<p>&ldquo;When I heard that Mrs. Vanderstein had no idea
where the house to which she was to go that night was
situated, but had left all details to Madame Querterot
and the Prince, I tried to convince her of the folly of
such an arrangement, but nothing I could say had any
effect. At last I told her that I should accompany her
on this escapade; and, though she didn&rsquo;t like the idea
and even grew quite angry with me about it, I stuck
to my point, and was so firm on the subject that in
the end she gave in and said I could come if I liked. It
was, all the same, with serious misgivings that I set
forth with her that evening for Covent Garden, where
we were first to attend the gala performance. We had
hardly entered the theatre when Mrs. Vanderstein
told me to run back and tell the motor not to come to
fetch us. We were to go away in a carriage sent by the
Prince, she said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was too much worried to enjoy the opera. I
don&rsquo;t know whether Mrs. Vanderstein did or not, but
she kept looking at her watch and fidgeting, so I think
her thoughts were elsewhere. Before the last act was
nearly over we left the box and went down into the
hall, which was nearly empty, and told a man to call
Mr. Targon&rsquo;s carriage, for so it appeared the Prince
was to be alluded to on this occasion. In a few minutes
a brougham drove up, drawn by a dun coloured horse,
which dished badly and had an odd white blaze across
its nose and one eye. I noticed, too, that it was driven<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
by a very odd-looking man, who wore a hat much
too large for him crammed down over his eyes and a
great scarf wrapped round his neck and high over his
chin and ears; though even so I could see that he wore
a beard, which is, to say the least of it, unusual in a
coachman.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;One moment,&rdquo; Jennins interrupted; &ldquo;do you think
you could recognise the horse, Miss Turner, if you should
see him again?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am nearly sure I should,&rdquo; Barbara replied.
&ldquo;There can&rsquo;t be many with a blaze like that. I am
more sure of it than I am of the driver. He drove
very badly,&rdquo; she went on, &ldquo;pulling up under the arch
with a jerk and throwing up his hands, each of which
clutched at a rein, nearly over his head. &lsquo;Surely
there is some mistake,&rsquo; I said. &lsquo;Are you from Mr.
Targon?&rsquo; &lsquo;I am from Mr. Targon,&rsquo; he answered
hoarsely, &lsquo;but I think there is a mistake, as you say; I
was to fetch one lady, not two.&rsquo; &lsquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s all right,&rsquo;
said Mrs. Vanderstein hurriedly. &lsquo;Jump in, Barbara.&rsquo;
And she got into the brougham herself, so that I had
no choice but to follow her, and we drove off.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh dear, how badly that man drove! Luckily
there was hardly any traffic about, but we bumped
into three things before we got to the top of Regent
Street, and went over the curb at the corners I don&rsquo;t
know how often. Once the carriage stopped and the
driver leant down and called through the window that
he had orders to fetch one lady, and that I must get
out. This I absolutely refused to do, and by this time
Mrs. Vanderstein was so much alarmed by the reckless
way in which he drove that I don&rsquo;t think she would
have allowed me to leave her even if I had wished to do
so. After a heated dispute a small crowd began to
gather round us, and the coachman seeing, I fancy,
the shadow of an approaching policeman, suddenly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
abandoned the contest, and whipping up his horse
we lurched forward again as the animal started with
a bound.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was a long drive, and towards the end of it I
lost all notion of direction and had no idea where we
were going. At last, with a final bump and jolt, we
drove in at the gate of a little house, which seemed
to stand back from the road in a tiny garden, and
pulled up with a jerk before a flight of steps, at the
top of which a door was flung open the moment we
stopped, and I recognised the figure of Madame
Querterot standing back from it in the half light of the
passage.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We got out, and Mrs. Vanderstein, who is timid
driving at any time, began to abuse the man in a very
angry tone. She had been thoroughly frightened,
poor dear, and had sat holding my hand with a white
face all the way, as I could see from time to time in the
light of a passing lamp. &lsquo;What do you mean by driving
like that?&rsquo; she called out from the pavement.
&lsquo;I think you are drunk. A nice thing, indeed. I
shall complain of you, do not fear. It is most disgraceful
to be in such a state. Never, never have I
been driven like that! It is a wonder we were not all
killed!&rsquo; The man flicked at the horse and drove away,
but Mrs. Vanderstein was so angry with him that she
actually made as if to follow. She only went a step
or two, however, and then with a laugh turned back,
and we went up the steps, into the house.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We were received by Madame Querterot, looking,
I must say, more tidy than usual, in a neat black dress
and a large apron, put on, I suppose, in keeping with
her part of parlourmaid. I was struck by the strange
expression on her face when she first caught sight of
me, and she murmured something to the effect that
Mrs. Vanderstein had promised to come alone; but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
my friend, who was still flushed from her encounter
with the coachman, did not answer her at all and
marched on with her chin in the air. Madame Querterot
recovered her usual amiability in a moment, and
with many smiles and blandishments conducted us
up to the drawing-room, where she left us, saying that
His Highness had not yet arrived.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There we waited for what seemed a long time;
twenty minutes perhaps, or half an hour. My friend
was very nervous and could not sit still, but walked
up and down, up and down, restlessly, the whole time.
Now she would plump down on a sofa and arrange herself
in a graceful attitude; a minute later she would
jump to her feet and run to the looking-glass to pat
her curls into place, or dab her nose with powder.
&lsquo;How do I look?&rsquo; she asked me more than once, and
hardly seemed to hear me when I answered her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;At last there was a slight noise downstairs; the
front door shut, and I could catch the mumble of
voices talking low. After what seemed again an
interminable delay the door opened and Madame
Querterot came in. &lsquo;If Mademoiselle will come with
me into another room for a short time,&rsquo; said she.
&lsquo;His Highness has just arrived.&rsquo; I only hesitated a
second. There was such an imploring look in Mrs.
Vanderstein&rsquo;s eyes that I could not refuse to go, much
as I disapproved of the whole thing. I took her hand,
and kissed her encouragingly, and then left the room
without a word; for indeed there was something
pathetic about her emotion, and I was too much moved
by it myself to trust my voice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Madame Querterot led me down to a small back
room that seemed to be a library, and left me,
shutting the door behind her. I heard feet ascending
the stairs, the drawing-room door open and shut, and
then all was still for a moment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Suddenly, however, there came a noise from above.
Something seemed to have been knocked over, then
came a sound of running footsteps and finally a dragging
noise as if a heavy object were being pulled across the
floor overhead. I started up in alarm. What was
happening upstairs? Surely there was something
wrong! Without waiting to think, I rushed into the
hall and tore upstairs and in at the drawing-room door.
I found myself confronted by a tall man with a thick
black beard and a pale, blotchy face. Behind him at
the further end of the room I caught a glimpse of Mrs.
Vanderstein, apparently lying on a sofa, and Madame
Querterot bending over her. &lsquo;What is it. Is she ill?&rsquo;
I cried. &lsquo;Take her away, take her away,&rsquo; exclaimed
Madame Querterot, looking up over her shoulder, and
before I had time to speak again I was hustled out of
the room by the tall man and dragged downstairs
again to the library. I was so infuriated at his daring
to touch me that I could scarcely speak, but I managed
to stammer again: &lsquo;Is she ill? Is Mrs. Vanderstein
ill?&rsquo; &lsquo;She is not feeling quite well,&rsquo; he replied, &lsquo;she
will be best without you.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I looked at him curiously. I had seen Prince
Felipe, and this was not he. Indeed I thought I recognised
the driver of the brougham. He was a strange-looking
man, dressed in ordinary day clothes, and I
noticed with astonishment that he wore thick brown
leather gloves on both hands. &lsquo;I think she will be
better with me,&rsquo; I said defiantly, and advanced towards
the door, but he barred the way. &lsquo;You must stay
here,&rsquo; he said. &lsquo;Must!&rsquo; I said; &lsquo;what do you mean?
Let me go this instant.&rsquo; He didn&rsquo;t answer, but just
stood with his back to the door, grinning in a foolish
way. &lsquo;Let me out, let me out,&rsquo; I exclaimed, on the
point of tears by this time, I am afraid. &lsquo;Let me
out or&mdash;or&mdash;I&rsquo;ll set fire to the house!&rsquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I caught up my scarf and held it towards the gas,
but the man leapt forward and, before I knew what he
was doing, had turned out the flame altogether, leaving
us in the dark. As I still stood, bewildered, I
heard the door open and in an instant he had vanished
through it and the key was turned in the lock outside.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This was followed by the sound of footsteps on the
stairs, and in the silence that succeeded it is no exaggeration
to say that the noise of my pulses throbbing
in my ears sounded as loud as the tramp of a whole
army on the march. I felt my way to a chair, and for a
time sat in a trembling silence, shaken and unstrung
by terror the most unnerving, if of the vaguest nature.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why would they not let me go to Mrs. Vanderstein
if she was ill? What was the matter with her?
Why had Madame Querterot looked as she did when
she saw me on the doorstep? What was she doing,
kneeling by the sofa? And, above all, what was the
meaning of the man&rsquo;s behaviour to me? It was,
I think, the touch of his hand, as he dragged me downstairs,
that took away my courage altogether.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I sat for a long while, immovable in the darkness.
From time to time sounds came from the room above,
but they did not convey any meaning to me. At
last I grew calmer, and indignation began to take the
place of my fears. I got up and moved about the
room, feeling my way as I went. In this manner I
soon had an idea of the position and character of the
furniture, even of the fire-place and the coal scuttle;
and I must have blacked my fingers nicely in the process.
I had a wild notion that it might be useful to
me to know where the poker was, though I had no
definite idea what I would do with it. Still, in one way
or another I was determined to escape from this imprisonment.
What did they mean by shutting me in
this room? They must, they should, let me out!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I began to cry for help. I felt my way to the
door and beat against it with my hands, but no answer
came. Then I had a brilliant thought&mdash;the room was
on the ground floor, surely I could get out of the window.
I reached it and tried to open it, but it was stiff and
heavy. In spite of all my efforts I could not raise the
sash. I groped for the poker again and, standing
back for fear of the splintering glass, I aimed a blow
at the place where I knew the window to be and heard
with delight the crash of a shattered pane. Even as
I delivered the blow, it struck me as curious that no
light came into the room from the night outside; and,
thrusting the poker through the hole I had broken, I
found to my dismay that there were strong wooden
shutters beyond it. But the noise I had made seemed
to have attracted some attention at last, for I heard
a door open and the sound of some one running down
the stairs.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A moment later the key was turned, and the door
opened just enough to let in the tall man, who shut it
behind him again as soon as he was inside. He had a
little electric torch, which he turned in my direction,
so that the glare blinded me and I couldn&rsquo;t see him at
all. &lsquo;It&rsquo;s no good making all this row, Miss Turner,&rsquo;
he said, &lsquo;no sort of earthly, kicking up such a shindy
as a young lady like you ought to be ashamed to raise.
Besides,&rsquo; he said, and now there was something in his
tone that turned me sick, &lsquo;it isn&rsquo;t <em>safe</em>. Do you
understand? It is not <em>safe</em>. Now, you see I don&rsquo;t
mean you any harm or I simply shouldn&rsquo;t bother to
warn you. But no, I like the look of you, and I&rsquo;m
sorry to see you in this house, where I tell you again
it&rsquo;s dangerous to stay. But be a sensible young lady
and do as I tell you, and I&rsquo;m blowed if I don&rsquo;t help
you to escape when the time comes. What do you say
to that? I can&rsquo;t say fairer, can I?&rsquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I suppose you will think me a dreadful coward,
but there was something about the man which frightened
me horribly. I think it was that he seemed to be
himself in the extremity of fear. How I gathered that
impression I am not sure. It may have been the low,
hurried agitation of his voice, or the way in which his
hand was shaking, so that the light behind which he
was concealed danced and wavered between us like
a will-o&rsquo;-the-wisp; or perhaps it was the mere telepathic
infection of fear. At all events I was ready to
agree to anything he said, and jumped at the idea of
escape. &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll do anything, I&rsquo;ll be as quiet as a mouse,&rsquo;
I cried beseechingly, &lsquo;if you&rsquo;ll only let me go away.&rsquo;
&lsquo;That&rsquo;s right,&rsquo; he said approvingly. &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll help you,
never fear. And to show that I mean it,&rsquo; he went on,
&lsquo;here&rsquo;s a change of clothes for you. You&rsquo;d never
escape in that white and red costume, you know.&rsquo;
He threw down a bundle on the table. &lsquo;Make haste
and get into these togs, and let me take away your
own things. I&rsquo;ll leave you the lamp to change by, but
you must look sharp, and mind you change every
single thing, down to your shift.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So saying he put down the lamp and left the room
again. No sooner was the door shut than I caught up
the lamp and ran to the window. Peering through
the glass, I tried to make out the fastening of the
shutters and to see if I could get at it by putting my
arm through the broken pane; but it was quite out
of reach and I realised that I could do nothing without
smashing more glass, and I did not dare do that now.
So I put down the lamp again, and fell to changing
my clothes as the man had suggested.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They were horrible clothes he had brought, and it
made me sick to put them on; but I felt he was right
in saying that I could not escape in my evening dress.
So, though I didn&rsquo;t see why I should change all my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
under things, I thought there might be some reason
for that also, and anyhow I think I was too much
frightened not to do as I was told. It was soon done,
but not too soon, for without so much as a knock the
wretch walked in again as I was fastening the last
button of the shabby coat over a chemise so rough
that my skin prickled all over. He looked at me with
some satisfaction. &lsquo;You must alter your hair,&rsquo; he
said; &lsquo;do it up tight and plain, so that it won&rsquo;t show
more than can be helped.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;With that, he gathered up my clothes and went
away, taking the lamp with him this time, and I saw
no more of him for a long while. There was no need
to twist my hair up so hurriedly, for after that was done
I sat down and waited for what seemed like days. It
was terrible, waiting, waiting, waiting in the darkness,
which my fears peopled with invisible presences, so
that I found myself holding my breath lest the door
handle should turn again, and some one, or some thing,
enter unheard by me. At the thought, I got up and
dragged a heavy chair across the room, where I sat
down on it with my back against the door, my anxiety
to get out quite forgotten and overwhelmed in the
awful possibility of not being certain whether or not I
were alone.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If only Mrs. Vanderstein had still been with me.
But, believe me, it was not only selfishly that I longed
for her: the vision of her, ill, and no doubt in danger
equal to mine as an inmate of this dreadful house, sat
on me like a nightmare; and, if I was frightened by
the peril of my own position, I trembled still more at
the danger to which my friend might be exposed.
Why was the man afraid? It was the recollection
of his terror that cowed me, so that I sat there rigid,
paralysed by the fear of I knew not what. From time
to time noises broke the silence, the noise of people<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
moving in the room above; and presently some one
descended the stairs and approached the door against
which I crouched.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A violent trembling fit seized me and my teeth
chattered so convulsively that I could hardly hear
the footsteps outside; but they passed on, and I heard
a door opened at the end of the passage. A minute
later they returned, sounding loud on the linoleum of
the hall and muffled as they went up the stairs; only
to come down again in a few moments. Over and over
again this process was repeated: some one apparently
walking down the stairs, down the passage, and through
a door at the back of the house, then retracing his
steps, and in a minute or two beginning all over again.
This went on, I should think, for more than an hour,
and then after an interval I heard two people come
down and go to the door; soon it was gently shut and
only one pair of feet returned.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Presently another noise began&mdash;rather a comforting,
familiar noise&mdash;the sound of sweeping and brushing,
both on the stairs and in the room overhead. It seemed
as if a housemaid were about, beginning the morning&rsquo;s
work, for by now I could see through a tiny space in the
shutters that it was daylight. I called out once: &lsquo;Is
there anyone there?&rsquo; at which the noise of sweeping
ceased, and a warning &lsquo;Hush&rsquo; was breathed at me
through the keyhole, close by my ear. After a time
all these sounds stopped altogether. The sweeper
passed my door again, and again went through the door
at the end of the passage. This time it was closed with
a snap of the lock, and then silence settled on the house.
I don&rsquo;t know how long I sat there without hearing a
sound. I think I must have dozed. I know I began to
feel so stiff and tired that fear seemed a secondary
consideration, and I didn&rsquo;t care what happened any
more. Heaven knows how long he left me there,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
dozing and waking, perhaps for hours, perhaps for
days. You know more about that than I do.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was after what seemed like a week that the
storm began. It was that which definitely roused me
from the sort of stupor into which I had fallen, and
stirred me to rack my brains again for some means of
escape. It was dreadfully hot in that little room; the
atmosphere was close and stifling till it seemed to weigh
one down with an unbearable oppression, and if it
had not been for the glass I had broken&mdash;through
which an occasional breath of air penetrated by way of
a crack in the shutter&mdash;I suppose it would have been
even worse than it was. From time to time I had been
conscious of the distant rumbling of thunder, and
hoped dimly that it would clear the air, for before the
storm actually burst my head was like to split; and
it was with a certain relief that I heard the first large
drops of rain begin to fall. Soon afterwards there
was a tremendous clap of thunder.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was appallingly hungry, and wondered if I were
being purposely left to die of starvation. With a
vague idea that I might find something edible I began
feeling about again around the room and considering
the possibility, if the worst came to the worst, of
eating my shoes, as I had heard of starving men being
forced to do. But I was not hungry enough for that
yet, and besides I wasn&rsquo;t sure if the soles of my satin
slippers were of leather, or only <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">papier m√¢ch√©</i>. On the
table my fingers came across a stump of pencil, and
that distracted my thoughts for a little while. I had
to feel it all over before I was sure what it was; it
was the point that made me almost certain, and I
began at once to ask myself whether I could not by
some means send a message to the outside world. I
could think of no way of doing so, however, and even
if I could have, I had nothing to write on. Then the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
idea came to me of writing on the wall. I thought
to myself that if the man meant to play me false, at
least I could leave a token of my presence, which
possibly at some future day might lead to the punishment
of these people. I knew there were pictures on
the walls, and feeling my way to the fire-place I lifted
up one hanging above it, so that by inserting my hand
under the frame I could write on that part of the wallpaper
which, as far as I could tell, lay behind.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I had only written a few words, when the key was
turned and the door opened. A rumbling of thunder
had prevented my hearing the sound of approaching
feet, and I had only just time to let the picture fall
back into its place and to move a few steps away from
the mantelpiece before the black-bearded man entered
the room. Fortunately, the chair I had pushed against
the door retarded its opening for a moment, or he
would have seen what I was doing. &lsquo;Come,&rsquo; he said,
taking hold of my arm, &lsquo;now is the time for you to
escape to a place of safety.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Without further words he led me into the hall, and
along it to the front door. Here we paused, while he
opened it very cautiously and peered out. For my
part, I was more nervous with regard to dangers that
might lurk in the house behind us; but his inspection
of the outside world seemed to satisfy him, for picking
up, to my astonishment, a large garden spade that was
leaning against the wall he opened the door wide and
we passed through it together. I cannot tell you with
what feelings of gladness and thankfulness I hastened
down the steps and out into the street, nor with what
joy I felt my unrestrained feet splashing into the puddles,
and the free air of the night blow freshly on my face.
We had gone some hundreds of yards and turned more
than one corner before I dared speak. &lsquo;What has
happened to my friend?&rsquo; I then said; &lsquo;has she escaped<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
too?&rsquo; &lsquo;She has gone,&rsquo; he answered evasively, and
still quickened his pace till I was half running to keep
up with him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was wild weather to be abroad: the storm was
still at its height and the flashes of lightning and the
thunder claps succeeded each other with increasing
frequency; rain was falling in torrents, the roads
and pavements were like seething rivers, and the gutters
ran a foot deep at the edge of the kerb, as I discovered
by stepping into one when we crossed the street.
There was not a soul to be seen except the black-cloaked
figure of an occasional policeman, and whenever we
approached one of these my companion gripped my arm
more tightly, and wheeled away in a new direction.
It was thus, with many turns and by circuitous routes,
that we progressed on our way. And, though I asked
more than once where we were going, not another word
did I extract from the black-bearded man; and I soon
fell the more readily into a like silence, as the rapid
pace at which we walked left me little breath for speech.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In this manner, and after we had hurried along
for at least half an hour, we made our way into an
enclosure, which I guessed to be Regent&rsquo;s Park. The
first elation caused by leaving the house where I had
been imprisoned was wearing off and I had time to ask
myself whither I was being led, receiving in reply no
very comforting assurances. Was I being taken from
one place of incarceration to another? I wondered, and
at the thought I tried to shake off the hand that lay
upon my arm. &lsquo;If you will let me go now,&rsquo; I said
timidly, &lsquo;I shall be all right by myself. I shall never
forget that you helped me to escape, but now, if you
don&rsquo;t mind, I&mdash;I had rather be alone.&rsquo; But I got no
answer, nor did the clutch on my arm relax. In a
fresh panic I made up my mind that the next time we
saw a policeman I would scream for help.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;It was not many minutes after I had taken this
decision that my companion paused in his rapid walk;
and after looking about him doubtfully seemed to
recognise some landmark in the darkness, and came to
a sudden halt. &lsquo;Can you get over these railings?&rsquo;
he said. We had been following the line of an iron
fence that bordered the path, and I could feel rather
than see that it reached above the height of my waist
and was ornamented with spikes. &lsquo;I think it is hardly
possible,&rsquo; I replied; &lsquo;but why should I get over?&rsquo;
He did not answer, but seemed to consider. &lsquo;I think
I can lift you over,&rsquo; he said at length, and before I could
object he had his arms around me, and with a tremendous
effort swung me up in the air and across the
railings. &lsquo;Now you must help me,&rsquo; he said, holding
tightly to my arm as I landed safely on the other side.
And partly by my help, partly by holding on to a tree
that leant up against the fence near by, he managed
to scramble over.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, by the roughness of the ground under my feet,
I knew we were on the grass, even before a flash of
lightning showed me that we had wandered away from
the fence and were standing on the top of an embankment,
at the bottom of which I caught sight of a high
wooden paling. With instinctive reluctance, I hung
back as my companion began to descend the bank,
tugging me in his wake. At the bottom of the hill
we came to the high wall, which we followed for a little
way, and presently stopped before an opening through
which I saw the gleam of water. &lsquo;We must get through
here,&rsquo; said the man. &lsquo;There&rsquo;s plenty of room where
these two boards have been torn off.&rsquo; There was, as
he said, a gap where some planks were missing and only
the cross pieces of wood remained. &lsquo;Why should
we go this way?&rsquo; I asked again, full of misgivings.
&lsquo;Where are you taking me?&rsquo; &lsquo;Where you will be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
safe,&rsquo; said he. &lsquo;Come on,&rsquo; and stepping before me
through the gap he dragged me roughly after him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then, for the first time, he suddenly removed the
hand that all this while had clutched me by the arm;
and as I stood there, bewildered, not knowing what to
do with my freedom, the scene was lighted up by a
tremendous flash, brighter than any that had gone
before, and I saw that he was fumbling with a cord
that was attached to the handle of the spade he carried.
His arms were stretched towards me, and before the
light had faded from the sky I realised that he was
trying to throw the end of the rope round my neck,
passing it from one hand to the other as he did
so.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps I leapt too suddenly to a conclusion, or
perhaps&mdash;as I think more likely&mdash;my understanding was
quickened by fear, but in that instant I became as
certain of his intention as though he had explained
it to me in every detail. He was going to drown me
in the canal, first tying the heavy spade to me to make
sure that I should sink, never to rise again. I screamed
aloud and pushed him away with all my strength.
On that steeply sloping bank he was at a disadvantage,
the rain had made it slippery, and for a minute I
frustrated his purpose. Then came another flash,
and by it the man seemed to catch sight of something
behind me, which at the same time horrified and infuriated
him, for I saw his expression change, and with a
snarl of frightened rage he lifted up the spade and hit
at me with it. Somehow I managed to jump aside,
but I saw him raise it for another blow, and after that&mdash;after
that&mdash;I can remember no more.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Barbara&rsquo;s story was finished. It had been told
slowly, and at intervals the girl lay back with closed
eyes, too weak to continue. But on any proposal
to defer her account to another day she had roused<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
herself, and proceeded with it resolutely till she came
to the end.</p>

<p>The shadows had time to grow long during the telling
of it, so that when at length, after they had finally
taken leave of the invalid and issued forth once more
from the doors of the hospital, the two men found
themselves again in the open air it was already dinnertime.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come back with me, Jennins, and have something
to eat,&rdquo; said Gimblet, as they walked away. &ldquo;There
is sure to be food of sorts ready for me at the
flat.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But Jennins was bound elsewhere.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to have a try at hunting out that horse,&rdquo;
he said. &ldquo;Miss Turner thinks she&rsquo;d know it again and,
as she says, the number of dun coloured beasts with
a decided dish and a peculiar crooked blaze of white
over the nose and one eye must be more or less limited.
Then, you remember, she thinks the driver was no other
than our friend West, and if, after he had set the ladies
down in Scholefield Avenue, he was less than half an
hour in making his reappearance, one may argue that
the stables were not half a mile away from No.&nbsp;13.
Don&rsquo;t you think I am right?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think your reasoning is perfectly sound,&rdquo; said
Gimblet. &ldquo;You ought to be able to find out something
about the horse without much trouble; and incidentally,
I hope, about the driver. Let me know as soon as
you have news. For my part I will try and see if I
can&rsquo;t get some information about him also. In the
meantime, I&rsquo;ve eaten nothing since breakfast, and
exhausted nature calls. I&rsquo;m off to get some
dinner.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suppose,&rdquo; Jennins called after him, &ldquo;from what
you said to me this afternoon, that you have ascertained<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
that this Madame Querterot is beyond our
reach for the moment?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Gimblet.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And do you think the girl, her daughter, has any
idea as to the woman&rsquo;s whereabouts?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Gimblet gently, &ldquo;I am sure she has
not.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In the flat Gimblet found a telegram awaiting him.
It was from Boulogne, and ran as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>&ldquo;Murdered woman not my aunt Mrs. Vanderstein
or anyone known to me there is no clue to her identity.</p>

<p class="sgn">
&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Sidney.</span>&rdquo;<br />
</p>
</div>

<p>Gimblet crumpled it up and flung it into a waste-paper
basket.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A pity to squander five shillings,&rdquo; he murmured,
&ldquo;in telling me what I already knew.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then he hastened hungrily to the dining-room.</p>

<p>After a hearty meal he felt considerably better, and
when he presently pushed back his chair and strolled
over to the open window he was ready and eager for
more work. His mind, which had been busy during
the meal with attempts to devise a plan that should
bring him to closer quarters with the person he most
desired to meet, that should cause the phantom figure
of Mr. West of the black beard to materialise and
become a solid form discernible to the naked eye and
capable of wearing handcuffs, had not yet furnished
him with a method by which this desirable object might
be attained.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Surely,&rdquo; he said to himself, &ldquo;I must be able to
trace Madame Querterot&rsquo;s meetings with this man.
It is impossible that she can have been on such terms
of intimacy with him without some one knowing
it.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span></p>

<p>He looked at his watch, helped himself to a sweet
from a box which stood on the shelf, and decided
to go down to Pimlico and see if he could not find out
something more from Julie. It was half-past nine,
but she was not likely to have gone to bed yet, and he
wanted a specimen of her mother&rsquo;s handwriting.</p>

<p>He went out and took a taxi to Warwick Square,
where he dismissed it, and pursued his way on
foot.</p>

<p>It was quite dark by now, with the soft blue darkness
of summer, for the weather had turned warm again
and the sun had gone down in a clear sky. There were
plenty of people about, as it was Saturday night;
many a small coin was being carried snug in its earner&rsquo;s
pocket that would no longer be lying there in a
couple of hours&rsquo; time, and the tills of the publicans
were already flooded with the rise of the weekly tide.</p>

<p>As he drew near the little shop in the gloomy, sordid
little street, the door of it opened suddenly and a man
came out and walked rapidly away. After a few steps
he paused; and, turning, gazed for a moment longingly
back at the window&mdash;from which a pale light shone
forth, so that the pavement beneath it was bathed in
a gentle radiance&mdash;before he swung round once more
and made off up the street. It happened that, as he
stood for that instant, hesitating perhaps whether or no
to return and make a final appeal to the girl he worshipped,
the light of the street lamp fell full upon his
white, haggard face; and Gimblet, with a start,
experienced the surprise of his life, as he realised that
he and Bert had met before.</p>

<p>Everything was clear to him now, and, with a sigh
of something between relief and regret, he abandoned
his proposed visit to Julie and went about the ordering
of more important business.</p>

<p>An hour later, Albert Tremmels, clerk to Messrs.
Ennidge and Pring, house agents, was arrested in his
lodgings for the murders of Mrs. Vanderstein and Madame
Querterot, and for the attempted murder of Miss
Turner.</p>

<p class="cap"><span class="upper">Bert</span> offered no resistance to the officers of the
law. Indeed, after the first moment, he
showed a kind of relief at his arrest, and went
with his captors almost gladly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I knew you&rsquo;d get me sooner or later,&rdquo; he said,
although warned that his words would be used against
him, &ldquo;and it&rsquo;s best to get it over. Julie won&rsquo;t ever
forgive me, let alone have anything to do with me, so
what have I got to live for? I can&rsquo;t go on like this;
no one could. Still, mind you, I&rsquo;m not so much to
blame as you think, and it&rsquo;s my belief any one of you
chaps would have done the same as I did, in my place.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bert had always been ready to justify himself.</p>

<p>He was willing enough to confess, to the police, to
the prison chaplain, to anyone. He showed, indeed,
considerable satisfaction, not to say pride, in the
interest his story excited, and was not a little annoyed
with Gimblet when he found there was practically
nothing he could tell the detective of which he was not
already aware. Bert did not dilate so much on his
love for Julie, the one real thing about him and the
innocent incentive of all his crimes.</p>

<p>It is perhaps best not to give the exact words in
which he poured forth the history of the dark deeds
in which he had been concerned, but to offer to the
reader a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">r√©sum√©</i> of his tale in so far as it was corroborated
by the evidence.</p>

<p>Albert Tremmel&rsquo;s father was a West End dairyman<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
who had the misfortune to marry above him, as the
saying is. He had a small shop in Hanover Street
and carried on a profitable business, but his wife despised
it from the first, and refused to allow their only child
to assist her husband when he became old enough to
do so. She wished him to be a clerk, and, as she had
a way of getting what she wanted, young Bert at the
age of eighteen had entered, in that capacity, the office
of Messrs. Ennidge and Pring, house and estate agents.
He was then, as later, a cadaverous, unpleasant-looking
youth, with a surly, combative temper and a strongly
marked tendency to look on most people as his natural
enemies. This in itself did not bring him friends, and
he made matters worse as often as he could by adopting
a dictatorial manner of speech and the habit of pointing
out to comparative strangers his opinion that they
erred in thinking they knew their own business. He
would also mention their duty as another thing they
were ignorant of. This line of conversation he varied
by assuring them that if it were true, as they would have
him believe, that they knew both better in any case
than he did, it was still more to be regretted that they
should mismanage the one and fail to do the other.</p>

<p>Boys of his own age frankly refused to have anything
to do with him, and he found his most congenial surroundings
at a Socialistic Club, where all the members
shared his disapproval of the world in general, and
descanted as much as they pleased on the shameful
conduct and character of those who were not of their
own way of thinking. Here all ranks and parts of the
community were equally denounced, and if one could
hardly find words strong enough to censure the attitude
of the rich who wished to retain control of their own
wealth, neither could one sufficiently display one&rsquo;s
anger and disgust at the behaviour of the poor who
showed themselves so regardless of the socialistic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
movement as to take benefits from the capitalist
classes. Fond as these young men were of employing
the words &ldquo;give&rdquo; and &ldquo;take,&rdquo; the meaning generally
conveyed by their joint use was peculiarly repugnant
to them. Take, in their view, should always come
first in any case, and a thing taken lost half its value
in their eyes if it came as a gift. They would have
abolished both generosity and gratitude from a world
that can ill afford the loss of those virtues.</p>

<p>Bert drank in every tenet of this creed, and revelled
in the discussions and execrations as much as he
delighted in the wishy-washy sentimentalism. He was
an unhealthy, discontented, miserable boy, his hand
against every one; and his club was the only place
where he felt himself more or less at his ease.</p>

<p>There was, however, one spot which he liked better
to be in, and that was the household of the Querterots.</p>

<p>He had gone to school with Julie Querterot, for it so
happened that Bert&rsquo;s father was a Lancashire man and
a Roman Catholic. It is true that when he died, as
he did when Bert was only thirteen, the boy&rsquo;s mother
immediately removed him to another school and saw
to it that he imbibed her hatred of Rome; but he did
not take any more kindly to her own church, and
when she herself died five or six years later he was
going pretty much his own way, which was a way
devoid of religious belief of any kind. In spite of
this, he never lost touch with his little schoolfellow;
and, as the Querterots dealt at Tremmels&rsquo; shop and the
children were always together, the two families became
acquainted, and a certain friendship even sprang up
between Madame Querterot and Mrs. Tremmels.
These ladies drank tea together, and smiled over the
devotion of Bert for little Julie. This was in the days
when prosperity reigned in both houses.</p>

<p>It was different after Mrs. Tremmels&rsquo; death, when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
Bert discovered that the business, of which he had never
been allowed to learn the details, was on the verge of
bankruptcy, Mrs. Tremmels having conducted it since
her husband&rsquo;s death with an eye more to her own aggrandisement
than to profit. She had opened two large
branches and started milk carts drawn by Shetland
ponies; and, having no capital, had borrowed money
to do it. Custom under her management had fallen
off; the branches had had to be closed; the smart
ponies sold; and, at the time of her death, she could
no longer find the interest on the borrowed money and
the mortgagees were at the point of foreclosing.</p>

<p>Bert, who spent half his evenings in advocating
the redistribution of wealth, did not at all enter into
the spirit of the thing when he found himself quietly
set on one side while his own wealth, that is to say,
the competency to which he had always believed himself
heir, was redistributed without anyone consulting
him. He took it very ill indeed, and said things about
his dead mother which would have brought him his
dismissal from the office if they had come to the ears
of either Mr. Ennidge or Mr. Pring. He had been in
their employment about a year when she died, and
had done fairly well in it, for he was not a bad worker,
nor even without intelligence of a kind. Still, he only
kept his post by the skin of his teeth, for he had been
in the office more than long enough for Mr. Pring to
take a violent dislike to him, and if it had not been for
the extremely kind heart of Mr. Ennidge, who argued
that he could not dismiss the youth to whom Fortune
had already dealt so severe a blow, Bert would have
been sacked a dozen times a week. He had, however,
no idea of this, and considered himself indispensable
and miserably underpaid.</p>

<p>He certainly was not paid a great deal, though more
than he was worth to Mr. Pring, at all events, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
Madame Querterot ceased abruptly to invite him to
her house. He continued, however, to visit it from
time to time, and a couple more years went by without
further event. Then came the sudden and tragic
failure of the Querterots. Eug√®ne Querterot shot
himself; and in the fallen state of their fortunes the
two impoverished women he left behind him were glad
of any friend who stood by them. The sudden dropping
off of their old acquaintances created a new bond
of sympathy between them and the young man, and
when they moved to Pimlico and he was the only
person who ever went to see them, he received a much
warmer welcome, at all events from the mother, than
he had lately grown to expect.</p>

<p>Gradually he went more and more often, until he
formed the habit of dropping in at least every other
evening. He had always been fond of Julie, and perhaps
of no one else in the world, since he had shown little
affection for his parents; now, as he saw her with
increasing frequency, his feelings for her became more
intense, till every day he seemed to see in her new and
more entrancing perfections, and even his enthusiasms
for Socialism faded under the continual protest of
her aversion to it. He admitted to himself with a
kind of thrill of self-defiance that Julie was so clever,
so sensible, so wonderfully reasonable and clear-sighted,
that her opinion on any subject could not be despised,
and it became more and more plain to him that if she
thought badly of Socialism that doctrine would find
difficulty in retaining his complete loyalty. To be
short, by the time she reached her eighteenth birthday
Bert was head over ears in love with the girl, and
had scarcely a thought in which she did not predominate.
Madame Querterot watched it all from beneath
her heavy eyelids. She said nothing, but the idea
that here was one who in time might be useful to her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
crept into her brain and took deep root there as the
weeks went by.</p>

<p>Julie was pious and devout. It was about this time
that she began to speak about entering a religious
sisterhood, but the storm of reproach and upbraiding
that this desire provoked in her mother caused her to
relinquish the idea for the time being, and, more particularly,
not to talk of it any more. The only visible
effect of the suggestion was that Madame Querterot
welcomed Bert more effusively than usual, and now
often invited him to stay to supper.</p>

<p>It may be judged how readily he accepted, and these
evenings were certainly the happiest hours in his life.
He used to come early and help Julie to lay the table,
and sometimes even to prepare the meal; and if her
sleeve chanced to brush against his shoulder as she
stooped over the fire or reached up to a shelf he would
be reduced to a state of speechless ecstasy, which
Madame Querterot found a pleasant change from the
usual aggressive torrent of his talk.</p>

<p>In spite of her quiet and demure ways, Julie had a
girlish fondness for dress and finery, and the offerings
that from time to time Bert laid at her feet, of gloves
and trinkets, were a great source of innocent pleasure
to her. There was a time when he sallied forth from
his lodgings armed with the savings of months, and
the intention of buying a ring, which he should present
to her accompanied by a speech he prepared for the
occasion, in which the secret of his heart was to be
imparted, together with the request that the ring should
be a token of their engagement. But his courage
failed him at the jeweller&rsquo;s counter; he felt suddenly
a conviction, amounting to a certainty, that Julie
would refuse; and, rather than risk knowing the worst,
he abandoned his project and spent his hoardings on
a brooch which he himself did not really admire, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
which Julie, when she received it, thought hideous.
The only person who was pleased was the jeweller,
who had had the thing in his shop two years and simply
loathed the sight of it.</p>

<p>It was soon after this that the great plan, of which
Madame Querterot had had the elements incubating
in her mind for a long while, was hatched, and presented
itself to her in a complete and material form.
She knew from the first that she could not carry it out
alone; and, casting over in her thoughts for the help
she required, saw in Bert a tool made ready to her hand.
When she broached her idea to him she had her design
prepared, down to every detail.</p>

<p>It was on the night when he had treated the two
women to the theatre, as has been related in an early
page of this narrative. Madame Querterot began by
telling the young man that she would never allow her
daughter to marry one so poor as himself, and added
quickly that she knew of a way by which he could
attain both money and the assistance of her influence
exerted on his behalf with Julie. Having excited his
curiosity and his hopes she bound him to secrecy and
disclosed her purpose to him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is yourself who gave me the good idea,&rdquo; she
assured him. &ldquo;It is your socialistic teaching, is it not,
to take from the rich? they have more than is reasonable,
those others!&rdquo;</p>

<p>They were walking up and down before the little
house in Pimlico where the Querterots lived in these
days of poverty; Julie had left them and gone to
bed; the glimmer of a candle came from behind a
blind in the room upstairs.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course they have,&rdquo; Bert grunted. &ldquo;But it&rsquo;s
no use your thinking you can take their money from
them without further legislation. What price the
police?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, the police,&rdquo; sighed Madame Querterot, &ldquo;if
only they would not meddle in what is not their affair!
But, look you, there are cases which are exceptional.
There are cases which ought to receive immediate
attention, which cry out for treatment of the most
drastic. If the law is slow&mdash;and I grant you that the
law has great need of alteration&mdash;when a matter is
exceptionally urgent, I say, the good citizen must
take it in his own hands to see justice done. And if
while we render a service to humanity we do so with
profit to ourselves, it is clear that the ends of justice
are doubly served.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bert could not help agreeing with these excellent
precepts. Indeed, Madame Querterot&rsquo;s air of supernatural
wisdom would have impressed the most
sceptical.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is not enough to talk, one must demonstrate
one&rsquo;s faith in a theory. By the means I shall propose
you can prove how well Socialism will work in practice;
for here will the poor, as represented by us, be made
richer, and yet the rich person who will have changed
our fortunes need scarcely feel any deprivation. You
remember my talking to you at supper-time about a
lady, a very wealthy lady, one of my clientele?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Bert. &ldquo;A Jewess, wasn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is true. A Jewess! And have not the Jews
for centuries ground the bones of the poor? Who
more fitted to be the first to contribute some of their
ill-gotten gains in return? Should they not be obliged
to restore some of that money which they never
earned?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I daresay,&rdquo; assented Bert; &ldquo;but I wish you&rsquo;d hurry
up and let&rsquo;s see what you&rsquo;re getting at, that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Eh bien! This woman, this Jewess, is enormously
rich, as I tell you. And what does she do with her
money? My friend, she covers herself with diamonds!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
It is those diamonds which I propose to myself to
deprive her of.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What, steal them?&rdquo; Bert&rsquo;s tone was troubled,
although in his heart he had known from the first
whither her talk drifted.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Steal! What a word.&rdquo; Impossible to convey
the contempt of Madame Querterot&rsquo;s tone. &ldquo;Is it
right then, that she should be permitted to have so
much when others starve? Is it right that she should
flaunt her jewels in the face of the hungry poor?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Madame Querterot, who had a good memory, went
on to quote phrase after phrase she had at various
times heard fall from Bert&rsquo;s own lips. She poured
his favourite catchwords into his ears, and strengthened
them with arguments of her own. She painted
the robbery she designed in such glowing colours that
you would have thought, to hear her, that it was a
sacrifice she was going to make for the good of humanity.
She passed imperceptibly to picturing the delight of
Julie when she should be presented with one of the less
easily identified jewels, to the readiness with which, at
the advice and with the glad consent of her mother,
she would accept the heart and hand of the prosperous
and enriched Albert, to the happiness of the young
couple ensconced in their charming house, surrounded
by motors, gramophones, champagne; in fine, all the
luxuries due to a girl of Julie&rsquo;s perfections. Madame
Querterot did not stop till she came to her own prospective
joys, her grandchildren climbing on her knee.
It was enough for the blushing and intoxicated Bert.
He surrendered, agreed to all she proposed, put himself
entirely under her directions, and these his prospective
mother-in-law willingly proceeded to give him.</p>

<p>She explained to him first at some length the character
of Mrs. Vanderstein, and the means by which
she hoped to play upon her weakness.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;There is,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;a young Prince&mdash;the Prince
Felipe of Targona&mdash;now in London and staying at
Fianti&rsquo;s Hotel in Grosvenor Street, which is situated
just opposite to the house of this Jewess. It so
happened to-day, as I was in the midst of my massaging,
that she jumped up and ran to the window to see this
young man pass, and I also looked out. Now by some
chance the Prince, as he drove by, happened to lift
his head and look straight into Mrs. Vanderstein&rsquo;s
face. It was a most lucky occurrence, and I could not
have hoped for anything so providential to arrive.
One would say, indeed, that it is an omen for me, a
mandate to carry out my plan. Mrs. Vanderstein was
delighted at this encounter of the eyes, and did not
disguise her pleasure. Well, see how simple is now my
part. I have in the shop some tortoise-shell combs,
purchased at a ridiculous price by that poor Eug√®ne
when we first started in business here in London. They
are very beautiful, of the finest workmanship, exquisitely
and intricately carved, but of a pattern antiquated
and <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">d√©mod√©</i>. We have never been able to sell them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now see, I shall take those combs, and present
myself at Fianti&rsquo;s with a petition that I may see the
Princess of Targona, mother of Prince Felipe. For
her I have a story that my husband was of Targona,
and that the combs also come from that country. I
shall offer them to Her Highness as a present from a
humble and expatriated subject, and say that my late
husband refused to part with them out of patriotism,
and, when everything else he possessed had to be sold,
clung always to the only objects he had left to remind
him of his beloved Targona. It is quite probable that
the Princess will be affected by this touching history.
She may even make me a present; but that is by the
way. What is really of importance is that I should
be left alone in one of the apartments occupied by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
Royal party for a few minutes. If I can manage that&mdash;and
I think you may have confidence that I will do
so&mdash;I shall obtain some pieces of the Prince&rsquo;s notepaper
on which his royal device or monogram is certainly
engraved; at all events it will bear some
distinguishing mark, and it will go hard if a few sheets
of it do not find their way into my bag.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The next step will be easy. I shall issue from the
hotel at a moment when I have ascertained, by peeping
from a window, that Mrs. Vanderstein is on her balcony,
where at a certain hour she very often goes to water
some flowers she has there. She will see me pass;
and, as she is very curious about all that goes on at
Fianti&rsquo;s, she will remark on the incident. I shall tell
her that I have been called by the Prince of Targona,
who has fallen madly in love with her at first sight.
You may think she will not believe this, but trust me
to make it plausible; and she will be readier to credit
such an idea than you imagine, for in the first place
all beautiful women are ready to believe that their
attractions are irresistible&mdash;and she is beautiful, this
Jewess, not unlike what I was myself when I was
younger&mdash;and in the second place, Mrs. Vanderstein
is of a nature romantic to the point of ridicule, and is
always, I am convinced, fabricating for herself stories
of heroes and princes, with herself for the heroine of
these fables.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How do I know, you ask me? I tell you I know.
I am a judge of character; I have an aptitude for that.
Eh bien! I shall convince the Jewess that she is
adored by a reigning Prince, with frenzy, with devotion,
with passion; that he thinks of nothing but her;
that he would put his hand in the fire for her sake,
that he is ready to abdicate his throne, to give up the
government of his country. In short, that he wishes
to marry her, and that if she will not listen to his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
addresses he has nothing further to live for in this world.
What is perhaps the weak point in my tale is the idea
that Prince Felipe should have chosen to make a confidante
of myself, but, believe me, my dear Bert,
I shall make even that appear not unnatural, and, as a
matter of fact, stranger things are done every day.
All this will take time, I do not know how long&mdash;days,
perhaps weeks. I must find out how long the Prince
stays in London,&rdquo; added Madame Querterot, more to
herself than to her companion.</p>

<p>It was the one thing she had forgotten.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I shall write her letters on the Royal notepaper,
and as she will send the answers by my hand, I shall
know their contents and be able to reply to them without
arousing any suspicions on her part. In his
impassioned epistles the Prince will beg for an interview;
he will lament the obstacles that prevent his
seeing her either at the hotel or in her own residence,
and he will finally, I am sure, persuade her to meet
him for the purpose of making his acquaintance, in a
house which he will indicate.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She will consent to all he proposes, or I am much
mistaken. It is at this point, my dear Bert, that
your assistance becomes so indispensable. You are
a house agent&rsquo;s clerk. I shall require a house; and it
is you who must take it for me, in an assumed name, of
course, and without the knowledge of your employers.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see how that can ever be done,&rdquo; Bert
objected.</p>

<p>They were still pacing slowly up and down the dingy
street. A policeman at the corner of the road looked
at them once or twice, decided they were harmless,
and ceased his attentions. The light in Julie&rsquo;s bedroom
was long since extinguished.</p>

<p>Madame Querterot cleared her throat and began
again.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;There will be a gentleman from India, let us say,&rdquo;
she resumed, &ldquo;who will call at the office at an hour
when the two partners are out. No one will regret
this more than yourself, but in their absence you will
do your best to attend to the requirements of the
gentleman from India. He will want a house, and he
will want it immediately. He will desire to take it by
the week and he will be ready to pay a large rent. He
is somewhat eccentric, this gentleman, and dislikes
meeting strangers. He will tell you to see about getting
a charwoman to make the house ready for him, and he
will settle then and there on the terms, on the day he
is to take possession, and upon every necessary detail.
Then, having signed the agreement, he will pay you
the first week&rsquo;s rent in advance&mdash;for which I will
provide the money&mdash;and he will walk out of the office.
You will tell Mr. Ennidge and Mr. Pring, when they
return, about the eccentric gentleman from India,
and they will not be suspicious about him since there
will be the money for the rent.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you going to act being this gentleman you&rsquo;re
talking about?&rdquo; asked Bert.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied Madame Querterot. &ldquo;He will not
exist at all; it is not necessary that he should ever
appear. But it may be very useful that he should
be thought to exist.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then who is to sign the lease?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You will do that,&rdquo; said the Frenchwoman, &ldquo;you
must begin at once to practise writing with your left
hand. Choose a short name&mdash;we will call him Mr.
West&mdash;and write it over and over again many times on
a sheet of foolscap, which you will always burn when
you have covered it. Never forget to burn it, Bert.
You will find it quite easy in a few days, and it will
not in the least resemble your own hand.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t half like it,&rdquo; Bert commented.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I promise you it will be all that is most simple.
The Indian gentleman will ask you personally to meet
him at the house on the day he takes possession, and
he will tell you to be sure to come yourself, as he dislikes
strangers and prefers not to do business with
more than one person. So you will get the house
ready for him and hand him the key and leave him in it.
That is all the trouble there will be about the house.
Not much to take, for the sake of gaining a fortune
and a charming wife, you must admit? The Vanderstein
will come to the house to meet Prince Felipe. She
will find us there, masked and unknown to her. We
shall relieve her of her jewels, which I shall have
arranged that she will wear; Prince Felipe is so fond of
jewellery, it is a perfect passion with him to see women
so adorned! So I shall tell her, and she will not fail
to bedeck herself with them. When all is done she
may return home; disappointed, I fear; but life
is full of disillusions, and the blame will rest on the
eccentric Mr. West from India.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was all very plausible. Bert could pick no holes
in the plan. He tried to offer one or two objections,
but was quickly overruled, and finally said good
night and went home to bed committed to aid and abet
Madame Querterot in her purpose to the best of his
power.</p>

<p>All went well. Madame Querterot succeeded even
beyond her expectations. The Vanderstein, as she
called her, was all a flutter of excitement and delight,
and Madame Querterot related to Bert at great length
and with huge enjoyment the scene in which she had
embarked upon the hoax, and the easy gullibility of
&ldquo;la Juive.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Figure to yourself,&rsquo; I said to her, &lsquo;that this
morning I receive a summons to Fianti&rsquo;s from a lady
in waiting on the Princess of Targona! What an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
honour! You can imagine my excitement! This
lady used formerly to stay much at her country&rsquo;s
legation here, in London, and she was in the habit
of making herself <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">coiff√©e</i> by that poor Eug√®ne. So it
appears that yesterday she sent for him; but, when
they told her that the poor dear was no longer on this
earth, she had the amiability to seek me out, having
heard of all our cruel misfortune, and asked that I
should present myself in his place. To-day, therefore,
I attended at the hotel, and had the pleasure of making
the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">coiffure</i> of a charming lady. Mais elle est charmante,
cette dame-l√†! But&mdash;and here follows the affair
that is of interest to you, madame&mdash;as I left the
apartment of the lady in waiting and was about to
descend the staircase, a voice called me back, and,
looking round, what was my surprise to perceive no
less a person than His Highness, Prince Felipe, who
appeared to be beckoning to me to join him in a dark
part of the passage.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Vanderstein interrupted me with sparkling
eyes. &lsquo;Do tell me,&rsquo; she cried, &lsquo;the words that His
Highness spoke to you! Sit down, Madame Justine,
and tell me every single thing you can remember about
it.&rsquo; I drew a chair close to the sofa where Mrs.
Vanderstein was seated, and I continued my narrative
in a confidential undertone. &lsquo;I could not imagine
what it was that Prince Felipe had to say to me, but I
thought for a moment that possibly his mother required
my services, and I was enchanted at the idea that perhaps
I was this day to dress the hair of a Royal personage.
But as soon as I drew near, the Prince began
to ask me questions of which at first I could not understand
the purport. Soon, however, I comprehended.
&ldquo;You live in this street?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;No, monsieur,&rdquo;
I replied; &ldquo;I live far from here.&rdquo; &ldquo;But I saw you,&rdquo;
he cried, &ldquo;I am convinced that it was you I saw!&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
&ldquo;When did Your Highness see me?&rdquo; I inquired. I was
indeed flattered that he should condescend to recognise
me. &ldquo;I saw you yesterday. You were looking out
of the window of a house opposite this hotel,&rdquo; said he
positively. &ldquo;Ah yes, monsieur, it is true. I was in
the house of Mrs. Vanderstein, one of my clients, and
we had the good fortune to see you drive past.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I began now to see why I was receiving the honour
of this interview. &ldquo;Mrs. Vanderstein!&rdquo; he exclaimed.
&ldquo;Is that then her name? But,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;there were
two ladies. Which was Mrs. Vanderstein?&rdquo; &ldquo;The
elder of the two, monsieur, the one whose hair is dark.&rdquo;
&ldquo;It is she,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Ah, how beautiful she is! In
all my life I have never seen a face that so haunts my
memory. It is the face I have dreamed of all these
years. But stay,&rdquo; cried he in a different tone and with
a look of despair. &ldquo;You call her Mrs. Vanderstein!
Am I to understand then that she is married? No
matter, her husband must perish! One of my gentlemen
may engage him in a duel. These things can
arrange themselves.&rdquo; Such were his words. Ah,
madame! one sees that His Highness is not used to
opposition.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Vanderstein was transformed. Her eyes flashed
with unaccustomed fires. Her cheeks were flushed,
her lips parted, her breath came a little quickly. I
was astonished at the change. &lsquo;She looks ten years
younger,&rsquo; I said to myself. &lsquo;Is it the massage that
has had an effect after all?&rsquo; Aloud I continued my
tale. &lsquo;I explained to the Prince that Mr. Vanderstein
had saved him the trouble of arranging a duel. &ldquo;Then,&rdquo;
cried he, &ldquo;there is no obstacle! Except,&rdquo; he added in
a different and depressed tone, &ldquo;the wishes of my
mother, and of the government of Targona. They
are very decided that I must marry for reasons of
state, but I have told them again and again that I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
will not do it. I will abdicate if they like, but I will
never marry except in accordance with the dictates of
my heart. And my heart has never before been
touched; so that I am sure now that there is but one
woman in the world for me. But how am I to meet her?
If anyone suspects my feelings, unimaginable difficulties
will be thrown in the way. And how can I ever win
the affections of the beautiful and adorable Mrs. Vanderstein,
if I cannot even imagine a means by which I
may make her acquaintance? One thing, however,
is sure. Without her I cannot live.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Ah, madame,&rsquo; I said, &lsquo;if you could have seen the
poor gentleman your heart would have ached for him.
On his face so sad an expression! He had an air so
miserable and disconsolate. One can see that he has
a tender nature! In his despair he strode up and down
the corridor, gesticulating with his hands, and rumpling
his hair&mdash;which is fine like silk&mdash;by tearing at it with
his fingers! Again and again he would clap his hand to
his forehead, or smite himself upon the breast, and, if
he abstained from bursting into actual tears, you may
be sure it was because the rigorous code, which forbids
any public display of feeling in persons of Royal blood,
would not allow him to show his emotion even in the
presence of so insignificant a person as myself. Ah,
the poor young man. I, madame, I, whom he noticed
as he would observe your looking-glass or your boot-lace,
felt myself ready to take him in my arms and to
embrace and comfort him like a mother.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I paused for breath, and Mrs. Vanderstein cried:
&lsquo;Oh, Madame Justine, is it really possible that he
should feel like that after only seeing me once, and
that at a distance?&rsquo; &lsquo;Love at first sight,&rsquo; I replied,
&lsquo;is not a thing of which one has never heard; and
assuredly he is in love, this poor Prince Felipe, or
I do not know what love is. Several times again he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
stopped in front of me, and cried out: &ldquo;How, how am
I to arouse her interest, gain her respect, above all
how can I win her heart, when I have no chance of
making myself known to her? I cannot hope that
she will be attracted by my personal appearance.
With one of her mental and spiritual superiority&mdash;as
I can see at a glance&mdash;my rank and position will
scarcely avail; it is, then, only by learning the depth
and sincerity of my passion, only by realising the fond
and tender quality of my love for her, that she may in
time be prevailed on to look not altogether unfavourably
upon my suit.&rdquo; And much more he said of the
same kind. As for me, madame, I assured him I
would, in a tactful way, convey to you some hints as
to the state of his feelings. He insisted that they should
be no more than hints, fearing that you would be
offended at his making of me a messenger; so if I
have, in my sympathy, overstepped the bounds of
discretion, you must judge the fault entirely my own
and not attribute it to any lack of manners on the part
of the Prince. His intentions are of the most perfect
correctness.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;He questioned me closely as to your way of life,
your opinions and habits. &ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;I see we
are made for one another, she and I. You say that
she likes to surround herself with pictures, flowers,
jewels, and the luxurious things of life. She is fond
of music and of the arts. Now remark this! I am a
collector of paintings and <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">objets d&rsquo;art</i>. I, too, adore
music and roses. I, also, have a passion for precious
stones and personal adornment. Wherein do we differ?
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Hein!</i> It is plain that we have the same tastes, that
I shall be <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">sympathique</i> to her. Oh, we must meet!
Somehow, somewhere I will arrange, if she consents,
that we should meet. Not here. Impossible! Not
at her house. I should feel my mother&rsquo;s eye on me.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
I could not escape observation if I merely crossed the
road. No, neither here nor there, but in some other
place of which I will consider. In the meanwhile do
you, with the utmost delicacy, sound her feelings as
regards myself, and prepare her for a further expression
of my own.&rdquo; I think, madame, that that is all that
passed between us, but I am to return to Fianti&rsquo;s
to-morrow and report to him whether you appeared
displeased.&rsquo; It seemed that Mrs. Vanderstein was
not displeased. She spoke very little more, but I
could see, by the happy, excited air she wore under her
assumed calm, that my words were having all the
effect I could wish.&rdquo;</p>

<p>All this Madame Querterot retailed with many
details to the interested and amazed Bert, and each
succeeding day she had new accounts of her cleverness
and success to relate. She wrote impassioned,
but eminently &ldquo;correct&rdquo; letters on the royal notepaper
she had filched in accordance with her plan, and
carried them to Mrs. Vanderstein with a hidden, jeering
smile at that lady&rsquo;s glad and confiding acceptance of
their authenticity.</p>

<p>The night of the gala performance at the opera was
fixed on for the deed, and at their every meeting
Madame Querterot repeated to Bert her instructions
as to the part played by the gentleman from India.
She elaborated and filled in her first sketch of his
character and behaviour, till at last the young man
almost believed in the real existence of Mr. West, and
certainly knew far more about him than about most
of the people with whom he was actually in daily contact,
for, as a rule, he was unobservant to the last
degree. She saw also to his learning to write with his
left hand, and he was able in a couple of days to do
this to her satisfaction. By now Bert was as keen
about the project as she could have wished. An<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
evening spent at his club had strengthened and confirmed
his conviction that no one woman had a right
to the exclusive enjoyment of so much wealth; and
he was now well assured that he would deserve nothing
but commendation for trying to readjust the scales.
There were moments when, for the fraction of an otherwise
optimistical second, he beheld a vision of Julie
as she would look at him if she ever heard of what was
contemplated; and it was a vision that caused in him
a catching of the breath. But the idea for the most
part only hovered in the background of his thoughts,
so that, while he was always conscious of its neighbourhood,
so to speak, he was able with an effort to
turn away his mental eyes, and to avoid looking it in
the face; and it was then that he would seem to
Madame Querterot most eager, most impatient for
the night to arrive.</p>

<p>The house in Scholefield Avenue was taken, and
Messrs. Ennidge and Pring showed themselves only
mildly interested in the mythical Mr. West, and that
chiefly on account of his readiness to pay a high rent.
Then a difficulty arose; and it was Bert, to his satisfaction
and pride, who suggested a way out of it.</p>

<p>Madame Querterot met him one evening with an
expression of dismay she made no attempt to conceal.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is after all something I have forgotten,&rdquo;
she cried. &ldquo;<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Nom d&rsquo;un nom!</i> that I can have been so
stupid, so idiot! Listen, it is this. The Jewess must
drive from the opera to Scholefield Avenue. But in
what? It is impossible that she should go in her own
automobile, and if she takes a taxi we are equally
betrayed. <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">A√Øe, a√Øe!</i> what to do?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXV" id="CHAPTER_XXV">CHAPTER XXV</a></h2>


<p class="cap"><span class="upper">It</span> was then that Bert had his brilliant idea.</p>

<p>To explain it, reference must be made again
to his family history. His father&rsquo;s sister had
married a grocer at Richmond, named Stodder, she
having been cook in a family at Hampton Court
previous to this event.</p>

<p>The pair had five children, and Bert, when a child,
was often taken down to visit his relations; in the hot
weather holidays the Stodders had him to stay with
them for most of the summer. The children hated
him, for he was a spoilt, ill-tempered little boy from the
start, but they had to put up with him, and he grew
up on familiar if rather quarrelsome terms with the
whole family.</p>

<p>The eldest boy, Ned, after he left school, was employed
in driving his father&rsquo;s cart about the neighbourhood
every day, in order to deliver orders received and
to collect fresh ones. It was Bert&rsquo;s favourite occupation
to sit in the back of the van, his legs dangling, or
kicking against the backboard, while he watched the
white roads slip under him and the grocer&rsquo;s dog trotting
with extended tongue beneath his drumming heels.
Ned was quite aware of the pleasure his cousin took
in this not very arduous form of exercise, and he soon
devised a way of turning it to his own profit. He
pointed out to Bert that he could not expect anyone
to put up with his company unless he did something
to make it worth their while, and that he for one would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
not suffer Bert&rsquo;s company in the van unless he justified
his presence by cleaning it when they came home, and
by helping to look after the harness and the horse.
Bert disliked work, but he hated to be cut off from his
drives, and, as Ned was quite firm besides being older
and stronger than he was, he told himself that needs
must&mdash;and Ned that he was the devil&mdash;and took up
the duties of stable boy.</p>

<p>Under his critical and unsparing master and to the
accompaniment of more than a few cuffs and kicks
when he tried to shirk his work, Bert became more
proficient in the care of the grocer&rsquo;s steed than any less
well-adjusted mixture of pain and pleasure would have
been likely to result in.</p>

<p>As a further reward, too, the stern Ned so far relented
as to allow him occasionally to take the reins. The
combination of discipline and fresh air did the Tremmels&rsquo;
boy a world of good, and that was a happy summer for
him. Unfortunately, when he returned to Hanover
Street his mother soon undid the good effects of Ned&rsquo;s
cuffings; and the following summer when he found
himself again under his uncle&rsquo;s hospitable roof Ned had
left it to enter private service in the stables, and his next
cousin had come out of school and succeeded to the
job of driving the van. Geoffrey was of a less good-humoured,
easy-going disposition than his brother Ned,
and Bert was at this age becoming more and more
objectionable; it was seldom that Geoffrey could be
induced to let him go with him on his rounds, but he
followed his brother&rsquo;s example in forcing his cousin
to assist him with the horse and cart when he returned
with them. This only enraged and embittered Bert,
and of the good done the year before the last remnant
was now utterly destroyed.</p>

<p>In the meantime, as the years went on, Ned grew up
a credit to his family, and a good and favoured servant.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
So rapid was his progress, and so astounding&mdash;as the
Tremmels said&mdash;his luck, that by the time he was three-and-twenty
he had risen to the situation of coachman to
an old lady named Mrs. Wilkinson, the aunt of his
former master. This lady kept only one horse and
a brougham, and with them drove out every afternoon,
in winter from three to five, in summer from four to
six. It was impossible to imagine an easier or more
comfortable place, and Bert often envied his cousin
the soft thing he had stepped into.</p>

<p>Ned was the only one of his relations whom he ever
went near nowadays, but he used often to go round to
his stable during the luncheon hour and explain to
the young coachman how little he deserved his good
fortune.</p>

<p>It was not till, for the first time, he beheld Madame
Querterot at a loss, not till he heard what in their great
plan she had forgotten to provide for, that he suddenly
realised that Ned&rsquo;s good fortune was possibly his own
as well.</p>

<p>&ldquo;See here,&rdquo; he said to the agitated Frenchwoman,
&ldquo;I can manage that part.&rdquo; And he told her of his
cousin the coachman.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Wilkinson, the lady he works for, has by the
rarest luck a house in the same street as the one I
have taken. She lives at No.&nbsp;1 Scholefield Avenue,
only a few doors away from No.&nbsp;13. More than that, it
happens that she has a large garden at the back of the
house, and the stable is situated at the end of it, quite
away from any other buildings. There&rsquo;s luck for you!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How is that?&rdquo; cried Madame Querterot, &ldquo;explain
yourself quick.&rdquo; She was very nervous and excited,
and for the only time during the whole business her
calm confidence deserted her. It was so near the hour!
She had already smoothed away so many difficulties,
done the impossible; and if all her hopes were to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
shattered now, and by so small an obstacle, it would
be, she told herself, the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">comble</i>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, this way,&rdquo; Bert reassured her. &ldquo;Ned is
always wanting to go home to Richmond, because the
young lady he&rsquo;s keeping company with lives down
there, though he makes out to me that it&rsquo;s his family
he wants to see. As if anyone wanted to see their
family! But his old lady drives out till six every day,
and by the time Ned has cleaned up and rubbed down
the horse, and fed him, and washed the brougham
and the rest of it, it&rsquo;s too late to get a decent train
down to Richmond, for it&rsquo;s a tidy way from Scholefield
Avenue to Gloucester Road, where the trains
connect.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now suppose I go to Ned, and tell him I know he
wants an evening off, and that if he likes I don&rsquo;t mind
doing his job for once, so as he can have it. I&rsquo;ll offer
to be about on Monday, when he comes in from taking
old Mrs. Wilkinson out for her drive, and to look after
the horse and to put it to bye-bye. I&rsquo;ve often done it
for him when I was a lad, so he knows I can manage,
though I don&rsquo;t say he won&rsquo;t be a bit surprised at my
offering, so to speak. I think perhaps I&rsquo;d best say
I&rsquo;ll do it for a consideration; he&rsquo;ll be good for a bob
where his young lady&rsquo;s concerned, I&rsquo;ll bet. What&rsquo;s
more, I&rsquo;ll say I&rsquo;ll feed the horse in the morning, so he
won&rsquo;t have to catch the last train back, but can stay
down home for the night. After I&rsquo;ve seen him off
the premises I&rsquo;ll get inside his livery&mdash;he&rsquo;s a bigger
man than me, though not so long in the leg&mdash;and I&rsquo;ll
put the horse in again and drive down to Covent Garden
and fetch the lady up. We can say the Prince is sending
his own carriage for her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Madame Querterot nearly wept on Bert&rsquo;s neck in
her joy and emotion.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You will save us, my dear friend!&rdquo; she exclaimed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
pressing his hand, a demonstration that he resented
by snatching it savagely away. &ldquo;What a mind,
what a genius, to think of so splendid, so heaven-given
a device! Let it be as you say. I am well assured
now that all will go well.&rdquo;</p>

<p>These last days were a busy time for Madame Querterot,
for there were certain personal details, essential
to the success of her plan, to be attended to: there
were bills to collect, sales to arrange, and purchases
to be made. At last all was done, everything ready,
and she stood in the hall of No.&nbsp;13 Scholefield Avenue
awaiting, with only the least flicker of the nerves, the
sound of wheels before the door.</p>

<hr class="l1" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXVI" id="CHAPTER_XXVI">CHAPTER XXVI</a></h2>


<p class="cap"><span class="upper">Early</span> as it was in the adventure, Bert was
already realising the difficulties of the part
he had to play. He had induced the gratified&mdash;though
suspicious and thankless&mdash;Ned to accept his
services in the matter of the horse; and, having seen
him depart with a small brown paper parcel&mdash;which
furnished the outward evidence of his intention to stay
the night with his people&mdash;had harnessed the animal
again in good time, arrayed himself in the livery
belonging to Ned, and adorned his chin with the false
beard provided by Madame Querterot, so that no time
should be wasted on his return. &ldquo;I do look a guy,&rdquo;
he said to himself, as he contemplated his reflection in
the strip of looking-glass in the harness-room.</p>

<p>Nothing remained but to drive down to Covent
Garden, and take his place on the rank of waiting
vehicles. This, he was surprised to find, was not so
easy as he had expected. He discovered that attempting
to control Mrs. Wilkinson&rsquo;s dun horse, which had a
willing spirit and a hard mouth, was a very different
affair from driving the old and sluggish beast that used
to meander between the shafts of his uncle&rsquo;s van.
Their progress was erratic in the extreme, and he
several times narrowly avoided an accident. The
Providence which looks after bad drivers did not fail
him, however, and at length he found himself, a good
deal to his surprise&mdash;for at one period of the journey
hope had altogether deserted him&mdash;forming one of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
the long string of motors and carriages that had
already drawn into line in the vicinity of the opera
house.</p>

<p>Now began a time during which the fear that the
expected summons would never reach him alternated
with something very like hope that it would not. As
he sat on the box, while minute after minute passed,
and still no voice cried for Mr. Targon&rsquo;s carriage, he
was beset with ever growing misgivings as to the
appearance he presented, and felt that his ill-fitting
livery and the false beard, which the scarf he had
wrapped round his neck and chin only partially concealed,
must be riveting upon him the eyes of every
beholder; so that not a look was cast in his direction
but he read in it distrust and suspicion.</p>

<p>Even the most seemingly interminable suspense
comes to an end at last, and he had not endured these
torments more than a short half-hour before the
words for which he had been waiting fell upon his ear,
and making his way out of the line he succeeded in
guiding the dun horse beneath the portico of the
theatre.</p>

<p>The safe accomplishment of this man&oelig;uvre, however,
fully occupied his every faculty, and it was only when
the carriage had come to a standstill before the doors
that he had time to glance in the direction of the lady
he was to carry off. With a shock of surprise and dismay
he saw that not one but two elegantly attired
women were about to enter the carriage.</p>

<p>He had not the courage for more than a feeble
remonstrance; indeed, it needed all the courage he
could muster to lift up his voice at all in the presence
of the waiting attendants, and in the brilliant glare
of the lamps. After he had driven some way in increasing
perplexity and irresolution, he stopped, and
tried again to induce Barbara to get out; but the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
attention the ensuing discussion aroused from the
passers-by and the sight of an approaching policeman
were too much for his nerves, and he decided hastily
to drive on and allow Madame Querterot to deal with
this unexpected complication. A glimpse of her face
when they arrived in Scholefield Avenue, and she saw
what had happened, did not add to his peace of mind.
He drove round to Mrs. Wilkinson&rsquo;s stables, extinguished
the carriage lamps, and unharnessed the dun horse
by the light of his pocket electric torch as quietly and
quickly as he might, his heart sinking at the prospect
of what she would say to him when he returned. It
was lucky that the stable gate opened on to such a
lonely street as the one which ran at the back of the
gardens of the houses in Scholefield Avenue.</p>

<p>A blank wall faced it across the road, studded at
intervals with the doors to the gardens at the back
of the houses in Westford Avenue, which lay beyond.
There was another stable some hundred yards further
down; but, unless some one were awake and about
in that direction, Bert knew that there was little
chance of his presence and movements being discovered.
Still he could not feel secure for a moment, and it
was not till he had put everything in some kind of
order and shut the door of the loose box behind him
that he breathed again. He hurried round to No.
13, seeing the fancied forms of lurking policemen behind
every tree and in every shadow, and it was with a hand
already shaking with agitation that he gave the three
taps on the door, with which it had been agreed that
he should signal his return to Madame Querterot.</p>

<p>She greeted him, as he had feared she would, with
a storm of whispered reproaches. What had he been
thinking of to bring that girl to the house? Was he
mad? As she looked at him, however, in the light
of the gas jet which burned at the foot of the stairs,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>
she saw plainly enough that he was in a state of nervousness
which she had not expected; and that, if he was
to be of any use to her in the crisis that was upon them,
she had better employ herself in soothing rather than
adding to his distress of mind.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, well,&rdquo; she interrupted her own words, &ldquo;it
is perhaps of no such great consequence. A little more
trouble, possibly, for you; but of that we will talk
later. For the moment we must get to business.
These summer nights are short and we have much to
do before morning. Go into the dining-room, while
I prevail upon Miss Turner to leave her friend. I will
put her in the library, where she will be out of the way
for the present.&rdquo;</p>

<p>After a few minutes, during which Bert waited,
breathless, in the darkness of the dining-room, she was
back again, and announced in a whisper that all was
well. Barbara had been shown into the back room;
and upstairs Mrs. Vanderstein, alone and expectant,
awaited the coming of the Prince.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She has got on all her jewels,&rdquo; sniggered the
Frenchwoman, drawing on her gloves. &ldquo;And she
little thinks that there are here two people who
appreciate them as her Prince never could. Ah!
Bah! Are there imbeciles in the world? Now then,
my friend, you know what you have to do. We rush
into the room, you seize this fair creature and hold
her fast, while I administer a little whiff of chloroform
that shall keep her quiet and prevent any outcry, so
that we can remove from her the gems at our ease.
See, I have the bottle ready. Allons donc; √† la
besogne!&rdquo;</p>

<p>They went softly and quickly up the stairs. Now
that the moment for action had arrived, Bert&rsquo;s confidence
was in some measure restored. The sight of
the diamonds glittering in the light of the brougham<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>
lamp, when Mrs. Vanderstein had stood upbraiding
him for his bad driving, had sharpened his appetite
for them, and the prospect of fingering the shining
things was a pleasant one. Inside the four walls of
the house, with the door bolted between them and the
interfering outside world, it seemed again safe and
desirable enough to take her jewels from this pampered
member of the idle rich, and afterwards to lead her
blindfolded to some sequestered place, as they had
planned, and there release her to find her own way
home. Even if she knew where the house was to which
she had been decoyed, it would be empty and discreetly
silent by the time she could bring to it the
avenging hosts of the police. He himself was so well
disguised that she never could recognise him again;
besides, she would only see him for one moment. True,
Madame Querterot was well known to her, but Madame
Querterot had her own plans for avoiding any unpleasant
consequences of their deed; so she had informed
him, and knowing her as he did, he never doubted
her intention and capacity of taking care of herself.
A medley of these thoughts was in his mind as they
mounted the stairs, and paused for an instant at the
drawing-room door. No sound came from behind
it, and with an encouraging whisper to her companion
Madame Querterot turned the handle and went in.</p>

<p>From the end of the room Mrs. Vanderstein rose to
greet them, with a radiant, blushing countenance.
Always a beautiful woman, she had never been more
lovely than at this moment. The smile faded from her
lips as she realised that here was not the lover she
looked to see; but before she had time to speak
Bert was beside her, clutching her round the waist
and dragging her back towards the sofa, while over the
mouth she opened with a remonstrating cry were
clapped the plump hands of Madame Querterot,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>
holding between them something that choked her
with its sickly, overwhelming odour.</p>

<p>&ldquo;See,&rdquo; said Madame Querterot, after a short
interval, &ldquo;see, she sleeps!&rdquo; But still she continued
to hold the mouth of the bottle over Mrs. Vanderstein&rsquo;s
mouth and nose.</p>

<p>It was at this moment that the door was flung open,
and Barbara rushed into the room.</p>

<p>Bert sprang to meet her, fully alive to the undesirability
of her presence. It hardly needed Madame
Querterot&rsquo;s cry of &ldquo;Take her away,&rdquo; to make him
grasp her by the arms, and half push, half carry her
out on to the landing and down the narrow stairs to
the library, where he left her after a minute or two
safely locked in. He listened for a little while outside
the door, for he fancied the girl might raise the alarm
or do some unimagined, desperate thing which should
imperil their safety. She had already threatened to
set fire to the house, and he racked his brains to guess
what might be her next move. He was in no hurry
to return to the drawing-room, moreover, for his heart
was beating unpleasantly fast, and the sight of the
helpless lady they had so violently treated, sinking
quiet and motionless on to the sofa, had filled him with
vague discomfort.</p>

<p>After all&mdash;the thought would not be kept away any
longer&mdash;what would Julie think of all this? Could
she ever be brought to care for a robber? Yes, that
was what he was&mdash;a robber. His fortifying socialistic
claptrap refused, somehow, to come to his aid in this
hour of need. What would Julie say? Already
misgivings undermined his unstable resolves. He sat
down half-way up the stairs and buried his face in his
hands.</p>

<p>It was ten minutes before he could make up his mind
to go back to the drawing-room.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span></p>

<p>Madame Querterot looked up quickly as he entered;
she was on her knees beside the unconscious form of
Mrs. Vanderstein, engaged in unfastening the clasp
of a bracelet. A bright silk-covered cushion lay on
the floor beside her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where have you been?&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Come and
help me to get these things off.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bert went over and stood opposite her. As his eyes
rested on the figure that lay so still upon the sofa, a
horrible doubt leapt into his mind. How white, how
dreadful Mrs. Vanderstein looked! How quiet, how
motionless she was. Could she indeed be sleeping?
There was no movement to show that she breathed.</p>

<p>Bert looked at Madame Querterot.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Madame Querterot!&rdquo; was all he could find to say.
But there was a world of accusation in his hoarse tones,
and the Frenchwoman, looking up in reply to his words,
was unable to stand the fixed stare with which he
glared into her face, as if expecting to read the terrible
truth upon it. Poor innocent, to look for the truth
upon that face!</p>

<p>Still, for once, she could not meet his eyes, and her
glance shifted furtively to one side.</p>

<p>He knew now; and in the horror and rage which
fell upon him he would have struck her, if the sofa on
which Mrs. Vanderstein was stretched had not been
between them.</p>

<p>With dropping jaw and eyes starting from his head
he thrust his face forward towards her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have killed her!&rdquo; he whispered.</p>

<p>Madame Querterot laughed a little nervously
&ldquo;It was an accident. I gave her a little more chloroform
than I had the intention.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is a lie. You meant to kill her all along.
That cushion! You have suffocated her! I see it
now. Oh! I see it in your face; murderess!&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Bert, don&rsquo;t be a fool!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, we&rsquo;ll see who&rsquo;s a fool,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;I am going
for the police!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My good Bert, you are, as I say, a fool,&rdquo; said
Madame Querterot, resuming with an effort her usual
assurance. &ldquo;For what will you fetch the police?
What will you tell them, eh? That you brought this
woman here in some one else&rsquo;s carriage, which you stole
for the purpose; and that I killed her, I suppose? A
likely story! When you are gone I shall scream and
run to Miss Turner, who knows me well; and her I
shall tell that you have done this thing, and that now
you would murder me, and her also. Do you think
the police would believe that I have done it? Why,
I am not stronger than Mrs. Vanderstein; it is impossible
that I could have done it alone, and they will see
that easily. But it is very possible that you could have
done it, and believe me, Bert, if you are not sensible
and do all that I tell you, it is you, and you alone, who
will dangle in the air as a sequel to this accident.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At this forecast, which he saw too plainly had a smack
of probability about it, Bert&rsquo;s resolution, never a
dependable feature in his composition, wavered and
failed him. He flung himself down in a corner of the
room, bewailing his fate and cursing his companion
with impartial heartiness.</p>

<p>Madame Querterot waited till he had exhausted
his powers of recrimination, and busied herself in
transferring the jewels from the body of Mrs. Vanderstein
to the bag she had provided for the purpose.</p>

<p>Then she had her turn.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What,&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;did you actually suppose I was
sufficiently imbecile to contemplate allowing this
woman to live, when her first act would have been to
have me arrested? How do you suppose either of us
could have escaped, when it was I who made all the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>
arrangements with her that she should come to this
house, and when she knew as well as you do that it was
I that chloroformed her? I could not have done it
without your help, so that you are as responsible
as I; and more, for it was you who brought her to the
house. You brought the other girl too, you great,
stupid, whimpering baby, and she will have to die as
well before either you or I are safe. And that will be
entirely your doing, for if she had not come she could
have lived till Doomsday for all I cared. Now, what
you have to do is to get the spade which I brought this
afternoon from the tool house in the garden, and dig
a grave under the trees at the back of the house, where
you can hide this.&rdquo; She patted the arm of Mrs.
Vanderstein with gruesome familiarity.</p>

<p>But Bert, sick and faint with horror, absolutely
refused to do as he was told in this matter. To go
down into the starlit garden, to dig for interminable
hours in the open, with every shadow full of unknown
terrors, which would leap on him from out of the
darkness, pounce on him from behind, come creeping
and gibbering at him with every leaf that stirred or
every chance footfall in a distant street! No. Again,
it was a long job to dig a grave; he knew that. The
ground would be hard; he would want a pickaxe.
In any case he would not do it.</p>

<p>Nothing Madame Querterot could say shook him in
this determination. She was growing really anxious,
for it wanted only two or three hours to dawn, and it
began to look as if the body must be left where it lay,
when, by a lucky inspiration, she thought of the flower
stand on the balcony. Would Bert help her there?
It would be quicker done and less dangerous if he would,
but if needs must, she said, she could manage that alone.</p>

<p>With a furious, shuddering sulkiness, Bert consented
to help.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span></p>

<p>He opened a window and undid the fastening of the
shutters. Then, after putting out the gas, they stepped
cautiously out on to the balcony, Madame Querterot
carrying the spade, and, stooping behind the balustrade,
peered anxiously up and down the deserted
street. There was no one to be seen or heard, and with
frenzied haste they began to pull up the plants which
adorned the flower box. At Madame Querterot&rsquo;s
direction Bert ladled out shovelfuls of loose soil, till
the box was more than half empty and the balcony
was heaped high with black mould.</p>

<p>They stole back to the drawing-room and Madame
Querterot took from a parcel that she had stored
away in a corner of the room a bundle of clothing,
which she told Bert to carry downstairs and give to
Miss Turner to put on.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It would never do,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;for either of them
to be found with clothes on them that could be identified
as their own. It would be best that never should
they be found at all, but it is well to be prepared for
everything, and though I fear Mrs. Vanderstein is sure
to come to light sooner or later, I prefer to take even
more precautions with regard to Miss Turner, as I
shall be obliged to leave the disposal of her to your
scanty wits. Tell the girl, therefore, some cock and
bull story about intending to help her to escape, so
that she may readily attire herself in these clothes,
which I had intended for the Vanderstein. They are
all bought in different rag shops, and there is nothing
on any of them to identify them by. Tell her also
to undo her hair and to screw it up plainly so as to
hide it as much as possible. Now go and do as I say.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But it is impossible,&rdquo; cried Bert, &ldquo;that that girl
should be killed too. I cannot, I will not let you
do it!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So far from letting me do it, my dear Bert,&rdquo; replied<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>
Madame Querterot placidly, &ldquo;it is probable that you
will have to do it yourself. But we will speak of that
again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bert went reluctantly on his mission, and by the
time he returned Madame Querterot had undressed
and decently enveloped the body in the chintz cover
of one of the sofas. Mrs. Vanderstein&rsquo;s clothes lay in
a heap on a chair near by, and the Frenchwoman was
vainly trying, with a silken petticoat, to rub away some
large stains which appeared on the carpet, beside the
couch. As Bert came in she got up quickly, abandoning
her efforts.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; he asked, &ldquo;what is that on the
floor?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothing. Only something I spilt. Some of the
chloroform. It can easily be hidden.&rdquo; And she pushed
the sofa over the place.</p>

<p>She said nothing to Bert about the vitriol she had
used, nor did he suspect it till the following Thursday
night, when he was obliged to undergo the ghastly
ordeal of seeing the body unearthed by Mr. Gimblet.</p>

<p>With a preliminary reconnaissance of the balcony
to make sure that no policeman was patrolling the
street below, the young man and the woman carried
out the body of their victim, laid it in the grave
they had made ready, and then fell in silence to the
task of restoring to the box the mound of earth that
was heaped upon the floor. When all was finished and
the flowers planted and blooming once more in their
former places, there still remained a quantity of soil
for which there was no room in the stand.</p>

<p>Madame Querterot fetched a couple of housemaid&rsquo;s
pails and they carried the superfluous mould out by
the back door to the garden, where they scattered
it widely upon the flower beds. It was a slow
business and necessitated many journeys, but by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span>
now Bert, in a paroxysm of fear, which was in part
for his own neck and almost as much at the certainty
that he would irretrievably lose Julie if any trace
should ever be discovered of that night&rsquo;s work, showed
himself more tractable, and by the time they had made
the place shipshape was ready to lend a receptive ear
to the proposals of his resourceful leader as to their
future conduct. At her suggestion they sat down
opposite to one another in the back of the drawing-room,
to talk over the best means of averting even a shadow
of suspicion.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We are safe enough,&rdquo; Madame Querterot asserted
positively; &ldquo;how is it you say? safe as a church!
Once the girl is disposed of, that is. Ah, my friend,
you made a mistake when you permitted the inclusion
of Miss Turner in the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">partie</i>, but it is not impossible
to remedy that error. Here is the chloroform. What
do you say? Shall we repeat the comedy which we
have just performed? For me, I am ready, for your
sake, to do my share.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; cried Bert with a shiver, &ldquo;not that, not
that! Besides,&rdquo; he added weakly, &ldquo;there is only one
flower box on the balcony.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is true,&rdquo; mused the Frenchwoman, &ldquo;that there
is no room there for another burial. And you still
refuse to dig a grave? Perhaps to-morrow night you
will have more courage?&rdquo; she suggested hopefully.</p>

<p>But of this Bert held out no hope. &ldquo;It would take too
long,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I might screw myself up to commence
the job, but I simply couldn&rsquo;t stick to it for an hour,
no more than I could fly. I&rsquo;ll do what I can, Madame
Querterot; I don&rsquo;t want to be hung for your beastly
murders, and if I can&rsquo;t keep my neck out of a noose any
other way I suppose I&rsquo;ve got to do what you say&mdash;within
reason, that is. It&rsquo;s the girl&rsquo;s life or mine
right enough, I believe, and I can&rsquo;t be blamed for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span>
thinking of myself first in such a case,&rdquo; said Bert,
nearly crying; &ldquo;though as a matter of fact it&rsquo;s not so
much myself I&rsquo;m thinking of, in a manner of speaking,
as it&rsquo;s Joolie. A nice thing for her it would be, to have
it said that her mother was hung! A fair treat, that
&rsquo;ud be!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s very considerate of you, I&rsquo;m sure, Bert, to
take that view,&rdquo; said Madame Querterot, with bitter
sarcasm, &ldquo;but it&rsquo;s no good talking like that if you
refuse to do anything to prevent such a scandal, which
I agree with you in thinking is one to be avoided if
possible. Here is another idea, though I think I am
too patient with you, and shall not waste much more
time in trying to assist you out of a danger you have
yourself brought upon us. Suppose you take the girl
out to a place where there is some deep water&mdash;there
is a canal near the Zoological Gardens, is there not?&mdash;and
push her in when she is walking beside it. She will
go with you willingly, if you let her think you are helping
her to escape, and you can find a pretext for attaching
something heavy to her first, so that she will not
trouble us by rising again to the surface. It should
be easy to do on a dark night, and there is no moon
now, as you know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bert had plenty of objections to raise to this plan,
and they discussed others with no better result. In
the end he was obliged to admit that drowning offered
the best and easiest solution to the difficulty, and she
wrung from him a promise that he would get rid of
the unfortunate young lady by this means on the
following night.</p>

<p>In vain Madame Querterot urged the danger of delay,
and the perils which would attend on their keeping
Barbara in the house for the next twenty-four hours.
Bert was obstinately determined not to venture forth
with her at this hour, for it wanted but a short time to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span>
sunrise and any delay would mean that the culminating
act must be performed after the full darkness of
the night had been diluted by the coming dawn.
Even Madame Querterot was obliged to admit that
there was something in his argument, and it was finally
decided that he should wait till another day had
passed.</p>

<p>In the meantime the Frenchwoman, as had previously
been arranged, would lose no time in leaving
England, carrying with her the jewels, which, she
assured Bert, would be very easy for her to dispose
of in her own country without detection, as she had
old friends there who were &ldquo;in that business.&rdquo; She
promised faithfully to send him one-half of the proceeds
as soon as she received the money.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And then, mon cher,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;you and Julie
will set up your little <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">m√©nage</i>. I think you will find
my daughter less capricious when I am gone. She
will be lonely, the poor little one, without her mother.&rdquo;
Madame Querterot&rsquo;s voice quavered with emotion
at the thought, and she lifted her handkerchief to her
face to wipe away a tear&mdash;or was it to conceal a
smile?</p>

<p>In spite of all assurances, she was unable to impart
to Bert her confidence in their safety from suspicion.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll see, something will give the whole show
away,&rdquo; he kept saying, half for the comfort of hearing
himself contradicted. &ldquo;Murder will out; that&rsquo;s well
known.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is impossible.&rdquo; Madame Querterot spoke with
refreshing conviction. &ldquo;Absolutely impossible if you
manage the canal affair with discretion. Consider.
You walk innocently along a public path by the
waterside, with a companion who, mon Dieu! is so
maladroit as to stumble and to fall in. If anyone should
be attracted by the splash, or she should scream and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span>
be heard, are you not doing your utmost to rescue
her?&mdash;though, if possible, at a different place on the
bank to the spot at which she displayed such unfortunate
clumsiness&mdash;but that is a remote chance, for with
proper care you will be able to manage so that the
contretemps occurs at a point from which no noise
will reach the ears of strangers.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know where there&rsquo;s a gap in the fence that runs
along the park side of the canal,&rdquo; Bert interrupted involuntarily.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mourning her loss,&rdquo; Madame Querterot went on,
&ldquo;but silently, you understand, you continue your walk,
and the world hears no more of Miss Barbara Turner.
Even if her body is eventually found, there will be
nothing on it which can be recognised as belonging
to any particular person; and who would connect
the wearer of the clothes I have provided with the
fashionable young lady, who may, perchance, be
missing from her home in Grosvenor Street? No
one. I repeat, no one. With regard to Mrs. Vanderstein
we are even more entirely beyond suspicion. In
the first place nobody will even enter this house for
some weeks at least. When they do so it is unlikely
that the flower stand will be touched. Though the
plants will be renewed there will be no occasion, as far
as I can see, to disturb the soil to a regrettable depth.
But admitting that luck may go against us and the
body be discovered, it will not be identified. I cut
off the initials that were embroidered on her chemise,
and the rest of the clothing I will take home with me
now, and burn before I start on my journey. And I
have a still better idea for diverting any suspicion from
us. Listen to this.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And she expounded to Bert a plan, which made him
open his eyes in unwilling admiration of the coolness
and courage of the woman. Such a course as she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span>
proposed to adopt would have been entirely beyond
his powers, and well he knew it; indeed at first sight
it seemed to require an almost inhuman audacity
to carry it out successfully. Her intention was to go
to a large hotel at some French watering place, Boulogne
or Dieppe for choice, and there to pass herself off as
Mrs. Vanderstein for a day or two, not long enough
for the Jewess&rsquo; friends to discover that she was there,
but long enough to allow no doubt to exist of her having
really been there when the fact should subsequently
come to be known.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I shall be far away by the time inquiries begin to
reach to the other side of the channel,&rdquo; she told Bert,
&ldquo;and the proprietor of the hotel will answer all questions
to our satisfaction. I shall so contrive that it
is not I who write my name in the visitors&rsquo; book. The
manager will be so obliging as to do it for me when he
hears that I have slightly injured my finger. But I
shall not be feeling very well, I shall need repose after
the journey. I think, yes, I think that I shall send
for the doctor. When he is gone I shall give out that
he has told me to keep to my room for a few days, and
I shall therefore remain upstairs during the whole of
my visit. When I leave I shall have established
beyond doubt that the lady I impersonate was staying
in the hotel when she was being sought in London,
and after that she will be looked for abroad. Once
the police have got the idea fixed in their stupid heads
that Mrs. Vanderstein has left England, they may dig
up her body as soon as they like, and I, for one, shall
not feel a moment&rsquo;s anxiety.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; objected the startled Bert, &ldquo;the people
at the hotel will describe you, and that will be a give
away.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They will describe me,&rdquo; said Madame Querterot
airily, &ldquo;or they will describe Mrs. Vanderstein. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span>
will be the same thing. We are much alike, she and I.
That is,&rdquo; she added hastily, &ldquo;we were much alike.
In the matter of the colour of my hair, it is true, I
must make a great sacrifice. But I have resolved to
forget the value that not I alone have always attached
to the golden hue of my <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">chevelure</i>, and to dye it black
this same morning, before I start on my travels. You
see that I shrink at nothing! I promise you that, with
a dress such as the Vanderstein would have worn and
a trifling alteration in my colouring, you yourself
would have doubts as to who I am. There will be no
risk to speak of, though it is worth a little to cover my
retreat by a stratagem so masterly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>With Bert&rsquo;s aid the clothes belonging to the two
ladies were folded and made into a tidy parcel, then with
a few more words of advice, and a special recommendation
never to come into the house without the precaution
of wearing gloves&mdash;for she was deeply impressed
with the dangers attendant on careless finger-prints&mdash;Madame
Querterot said a hasty farewell, the early
summer dawn being at hand, and in another moment
the back door of the house had shut behind her vanishing
figure.</p>

<p>Bert, left alone without the support of the woman&rsquo;s
ready resource and calm confidence, would have soon
sunk again into despair if his time had not been too
much occupied to admit of reflection. He was by now,
besides, so tired and exhausted with the emotions he
had undergone as to be incapable of coherent thought,
and he was more than content to give his whole mind
to carrying out the instructions he had received.</p>

<p>His first business was to get a brush from the cupboard
under the stairs and to sweep and brush the
floor of the hall, and the carpets of the stairs and drawing-room.
He was awkward at the work, but made up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span>
in thoroughness what he lacked in skill. Little shining
pieces of paste off Mrs. Vanderstein&rsquo;s dress were
scattered everywhere; he swept up quantities of them,
but still some, better concealed than others, escaped
his diligence.</p>

<p>Then having set straight such of the furniture as
had been moved or disarranged, he quietly opened the
dining-room shutters and those of the back drawing-room,
for he did not wish the place to look uninhabited.
The shutters of the front drawing-room, however,
he could not bring himself to touch, though he seemed
to hear the words of scorn which Madame Querterot
would have used if she had still been present. He
listened at the door of the library for some time, but
not a sound came from within; at last, seeing no more
to do, he stole quietly out of the house and back to
his lodgings, where, in spite of the fears that pursued
him and the dreadful memory of the night&rsquo;s work, he
soon slept the sleep of exhaustion.</p>

<p>Not for long, however. In a couple of hours his
alarm clock awakened him, and he started up to face
the new terrors which the day would bring. He had
to feed the dun horse, he remembered; it would not
do to annoy Ned.</p>

<p>After that came breakfast, for which he was surprised
to find he had a certain appetite, and soon
it was time to begin his daily routine at Ennidge and
Pring&rsquo;s office.</p>

<p>Every time the door opened that day, and on the
days that succeeded it, Bert expected to see a policeman
enter. But the evening came without any such
nightmare materialising, and he even managed to
snatch some more uneasy slumber during the evening,
before he once more assumed his disguising beard and
stealthily returned to the house in Scholefield Avenue,
knowing that before him lay far the worst part of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span>
whole business. He was too frightened for his own
safety, however, to hesitate.</p>

<p>Madame Querterot had counted on that when she
mentally balanced his regard for his own neck against
what she would have designated his milksoppy squeamishness.
It was hard to stay in that house of death
alone and in the dark, waiting till the small hours,
when his project might be best entered upon.</p>

<p>Bert was very, very sorry for himself as he sat,
trembling violently, in an arm-chair in the dining-room.
His pity did not extend to the other side of
the partition wall, where the girl whose life he was about
to take had sat in the same darkness and solitude for
the last twenty-four hours. For her, Bert, thoroughly
selfish by nature and education&mdash;as, cowering among
the shadows in the grim company of his fears, he
shuddered away the hours&mdash;was shaken from start to
finish by no disabling pang of sympathy. Though at
times his heart was like to burst with compassion,
it held barely enough to meet the urgent need of Albert
Tremmels; and when like her he heard the far-off
murmurs which heralded the approaching storm and
the angry boom of the thunder began to rumble closer
and closer, though he started at each clap as if it were
indeed the wrathful voice of the Avenger drawing near
to him, his whole being cried out in resentful protest
against this judgment that was being passed on him
in the heavens, and against the certainty that it would
be endorsed by mankind.</p>

<p>His intention was to wait till two o&rsquo;clock, but it
was not yet half-past one when he got to his feet,
unable to face his solitary vigil any longer. Better
get it over, he said to himself, like a patient in a dentist&rsquo;s
room who has got to have a tooth out. Only this tooth
was not his. He had long since decided that the spade
would be the best thing to ensure the sinking of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span>
victim, and he had placed it, with a piece of cord tied
to it, ready by the door.</p>

<p>Weighted with that heavy piece of iron, so he comforted
himself, there would be a single splash and all
would be over. He would be spared the sight of a
struggling figure rising to the surface, perhaps crying
to him for help or mercy, which above all things was
what he most dreaded.</p>

<p>Fortifying himself with a mental vision, in which
Julie, the hangman, and the body in the flower stand
upstairs were all mingled, he unlocked the library door
and pushed it open.</p>

<p>It is not necessary to tell again of his walk with
Barbara through the drenching rain and clamour of
the storm, which was more severe and prolonged than
any of those that burst over London during a year
remarkable for the number and fierceness of its
atmospheric disturbances. The horror with which,
at the last moment, as he was trying to tie the spade
to Barbara before pushing her into the water, he beheld
the running figure of the advancing policeman need not
be described. In a frenzy of disappointment, rage and
fear, he lifted the spade and struck at the girl again
and again, missing her the first time, and, as the handle
twisted in his weak grasp, bringing it down flat on the
top of her head at the second blow, instead of edgeways
as he was trying to do. He did not stay to see
the result, but throwing down the spade fled for dear
life.</p>

<p>His legs were long, and he could run fast for a short
distance. In a few minutes he had lost himself and
his pursuer in the darkness, but he still ran blindly on,
till his utmost efforts would drag him no further, when
he threw himself at full length on one of the park seats
and endeavoured to still his panting, laboured breath.
If the policeman should come upon him now, he thought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span>
his only chance lay in being able to simulate profound
slumber. Luckily the working powers of this plan
were not put to the test. Minutes passed, and no one
came near him. It was some time before he could
convince himself that he had eluded all pursuit for
the present. When he was at last sure of it the fact
heartened him wonderfully. If he could so easily
escape when caught in the actual perpetration of a
violent attack, it would bother the authorities indeed
to fasten on him as one of those concerned in a crime
so well concealed as that in which he had only unwillingly
assisted.</p>

<p>It was when he remembered that he was quite
ignorant of the damage he had inflicted on Barbara that
doubts assailed him again. It seemed to him that he
must have killed her. But if not ... if not? Why
then, even though she could hardly denounce him, she
would not forget Madame Querterot. And Madame
Querterot&rsquo;s first line of defence would be to accuse him,
as she herself had declared.</p>

<p>Curse the woman, how he hated her! From first
to last everything was her doing; he wished, oh, how
he wished that it was she he had killed. If he had
thought of that sooner, he told himself savagely, all
these troubles would have been saved. As things were
he would probably be arrested that day.</p>

<p>He did not lose his head, however, and went back
presently to Scholefield Avenue, where he cleared away
the broken glass in the library and put everything in
that room to rights, as he had already done upstairs.
Then he conquered his repugnance and went out on
to the balcony with his brush, and swept up a handful
or so of earth, which they had not been able to remove
with the spade.</p>

<p>He did not know how to get rid of the broken glass,
as by now it was daylight and he did not dare go out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span>
to bury it in the garden; so he left it in the dustpan,
and swept the grains of soil into an old newspaper, which
he crumpled up and thrust into the back of the cupboard
in the basement. Then he closed the shutters
again, for he could not bear to be a moment in the room
without the friendly screen that interposed between
him and the flower stand. Finding, however, no more
to do upstairs, he went down, and knocked out the pieces
of the window pane in the library that still remained
stuck in the frame; he thought that the empty space
might well pass unobserved for a considerable time.
In doing this he cut his hand, through the glove he
was wearing in obedience to Madame Querterot&rsquo;s
reiterated commands, and some drops of blood fell
on to the shining tin of the dustpan, but he wiped them
off carefully and polished the pan with his sleeve as
it had certainly never been polished since it left the
shop and entered into domestic service.</p>

<p>At last his anxious mind could suggest nothing
further, and he surveyed the results of his efforts
with some complacency.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m bothered,&rdquo; said Bert to himself, &ldquo;if the brainiest
detective on this rotten earth could set his fingers on
a clue now.&rdquo;</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXVII" id="CHAPTER_XXVII">CHAPTER XXVII</a></h2>


<p class="cap"><span class="upper">There</span> was no sleep for him that morning,
and he felt wretchedly ill and exhausted
when the time came to go to the office. Mr.
Ennidge, always kind, remarked sympathetically
upon his looks, and he replied that he had been kept
awake all night by the storm. The day passed without
the expected appearance of the policeman, though
he saw in the papers the first allusion to the disappearance
of Mrs. Vanderstein and Miss Turner, and felt a
horrified sinking at the heart when he read that
search was being made, even though he had of course
known all along that there must be a hue and cry.</p>

<p>He could not find any reference to his exploit in
Regent&rsquo;s Park, and he was afraid this meant that the
girl had survived, for if he had killed her surely there
would have been some mention of it. Yet if she were
alive it was strange that Miss Turner should still be
thought to be missing. Perhaps it was a dodge of the
police to fill him with false confidence. He could not
guess what it meant, anyhow, and at all events he was
thankful for one thing: that he had cleared up and
finished with Scholefield Avenue. If they thought
they would catch him there again they were jolly well
wrong. He would never set foot in the place again,
so help him!</p>

<p>He supposed that his confederate had got clear away,
and after his work was over he went to see Julie, to
make sure that everything had gone well.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span></p>

<p>He found her in despair at her mother&rsquo;s departure,
or, rather, at the manner of it; and it was with the
utmost horror and indignation that he learned that
Julie&mdash;as she afterwards admitted to Gimblet&mdash;had
been left absolutely penniless. All his savings had been
willingly given to Madame Querterot to help her flight,
but he had things which could be pawned, and he
pressed Julie to accept his assistance. This she would
not do.</p>

<p>Then she showed him the string of pearls, and he
recognised it at once as the necklace Mrs. Vanderstein
had worn. He had seen since, in the newspapers,
that these enormous pearls were well known to every
jeweller in Europe, and there had not been wanting
forecasts to the effect that, if they had been stolen,
an attempt to sell them would lead to the arrest of the
thieves. He had wondered if Madame Querterot
knew this, and reassured himself by thinking that, if
she did not, the friends she was to consult certainly
would. But now, with passionate resentment, he
realised that she had known it very well and had left
the necklace to Julie, careless of the suspicion that
might fall on her daughter if she should be tempted
to try and sell it. Nay, it seemed even possible that
she deliberately wished to cast suspicion upon Julie;
her action was otherwise unaccountable. But was it
possible that she would risk not only his safety but her
own, in order to gratify her spite against her daughter?</p>

<p>Before he had fully grasped the meaning of this last
man&oelig;uvre on the part of the woman he hoped to call
his mother-in-law, Julie was telling him of the clothes
her mother had given her, and which she had already
sold to a second-hand dealer. In hoarse tones he
demanded a description of the garments, and, when he
had received it, burst forth into such raging comments
on the girl&rsquo;s folly in selling them, and such furious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span>
imprecations at the wickedness and stupidity of her
mother, that Julie took offence, and in a fit of anger
as hot as his own, though less justly provoked, told him
to leave the house.</p>

<p>He was all penitence in a moment, and she ended by
accepting his grovelling apologies. All the same, the
fire of his wrath was not extinguished, but smouldered
with a dull red heat in his heart, ready at any moment
to leap into a fierce flame, burning to consume and
devour.</p>

<p>When the night came he could not sleep, in spite, or
perhaps because, of his extreme fatigue and harassed
nerves. Not till daylight did he drop at last into an
uneasy slumber, from which a nightmare sent him
leaping up in bed, disturbing the house with his cries.
His irate landlady appeared in his room, in extreme
deshabille, and her scathing references to delirium
tremens gave him the idea of the brandy bottle. He
bought one at the nearest public-house the moment he
was dressed, and drank a good wineglassful before
he opened the daily paper that he procured at the same
time.</p>

<p>There was nothing new in it, however. Though it
contained plenty of allusions to the missing ladies
there was nothing about a girl being knocked on the
head in Regent&rsquo;s Park; and to Bert&rsquo;s fears this silence
appeared ominous as a denunciation. He found the
brandy very comforting, and took it to the office with
him. There his appearance&mdash;rendered still more
ghastly by want of sleep than it had been on the preceding
days&mdash;moved Mr. Ennidge to such genuine
concern that, Mr. Pring being away and not returning
till Monday, he told Bert he had better take a holiday
on the next day, which would be Friday.</p>

<p>In the afternoon he was beginning to feel a little
better and to hope that after all things were going<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span>
right for him somehow, when at the eleventh hour Mr.
Gimblet made his appearance upon the scene. From
the moment when Bert understood who he was and
what was his business, he gave himself up for lost.
Some unsuspected gleam of courage came to his aid
now, however&mdash;a sort of phantom of the real thing,
found, it may be imagined, in the brandy bottle&mdash;and
he made up his mind that, if he must be taken, it
should not be due, at all events, to any revelation of his
own.</p>

<p>The agony of mind endured during the hours which
followed is not to be described in mere words. The
dread, the suspense, the feeling of physical weakness
which nearly overcame him as he witnessed the detective&rsquo;s
search, and the final horrible moment when he
saw the body of the poor lady drawn from the grave
where he had thought it hidden for ever from his own,
if not from every other eye, would have strained the
nerve of any man. It was, indeed, a heaping of horror
upon horror.</p>

<p>What unthinkable clairvoyance, what supernatural
omniscience had led Gimblet to pick out that house,
of all the dwellings in the great city and its suburbs,
for his investigations, was as much beyond Bert&rsquo;s
imagination as the means by which he himself succeeded
in refraining from revealing, then and there, the
part he had taken in the ghastly business.</p>

<p>To his almost incredulous astonishment no one
seemed to suspect him, and instead of being removed
in irons, as he expected, he found himself free to return
to his lodgings, there to recuperate from the shocks he
had sustained, in a deep, brandy induced sleep.</p>

<p>The next morning he was out early, and the first
poster gave him the news that Mrs. Vanderstein was
found, and staying at Boulogne. He bought the paper,
and, even as he read the paragraph in which the news<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span>
was related, made up his mind to spend the holiday
given him by Mr. Ennidge in running over to Boulogne
to see Madame Querterot. He had no definite idea
in doing so. But his rage at her treatment of her
daughter was still red-hot, and now was added to it a
furious resentment at her departure from the conduct
they had agreed she should observe. What possessed
her not to stay quietly in her room? It was madness
to have gone out; yes, actually to have gone to the
Casino, the place of all others where she was most
likely to be seen by some acquaintances of Mrs. Vanderstein&rsquo;s.
Did she want to lose them all by her folly and
recklessness?</p>

<p>And in any case he could not rest till he had told her
what he thought of her.</p>

<p>He went out to a pawnbroker&rsquo;s, and by pawning his
watch and some odds and ends of jewellery that had
belonged to his mother collected enough money for
the return journey. Then he took a taxi for the first
time in his life, and drove to Whitehall. He had seen
Gimblet&rsquo;s address on the card he sent in to Mr.
Ennidge.</p>

<p>Higgs told him, in answer to his inquiries, that the
inquest would not be till the next day, so that there
was nothing to prevent him from taking the ten o&rsquo;clock
train from Charing Cross. There was time before it
started to put on his false beard, in an empty waiting-room,
and to gulp down a strong dose of brandy at the
bar of the refreshment-room. He felt safer when he
had taken these precautions, for he had been haunted
by an uneasy feeling that Higgs might have followed
him from the flat.</p>

<p>The journey was uneventful, the sea as smooth as a
pond. He hardly knew how the time passed before
they arrived at Boulogne pier.</p>

<p>He walked round the harbour, asking the way by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span>
simple repetition of the words &ldquo;H√¥tel de Douvres,&rdquo;
and following the direction in which the fingers of those
who answered him were pointed.</p>

<p>Soon he came upon the hotel on the Digue, facing
the sea. The name in golden letters a yard long
danced before his eyes, but with a great effort of the
will he steadied himself, and passed through the door
into the hall.</p>

<p>As luck would have it there was no one about, and
the only person to come forward at his entrance was a
small page or lift boy.</p>

<p>Yes, Madame Vanderstein was in her room. Would
Monsieur go up?</p>

<p>Certainly Monsieur would; and he was ushered into
the lift and carried aloft.</p>

<p>He heard Madame Querterot&rsquo;s voice say &ldquo;Come in&rdquo;
in response to the boy&rsquo;s knock, and in another minute
he was in the room, with the door closing behind him.</p>

<p>For a moment he thought there must be some mistake,
and, if she had not spoken, would have turned and
fled. Surely he had never seen before the beautifully
dressed, dark-haired lady who was bending over a
box at the end of the room.</p>

<p>But at the sound of her voice he knew her again,
though the difference in her appearance caused by her
dyed hair and painted complexion was truly marvellous.
She wore her elaborate dress with quiet
assurance, and jewels sparkled at her throat, in her
ears, on her fingers, her wrists.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What in the world are you doing here?&rdquo; she said,
in a tone of the deepest disapproval.</p>

<p>Bert&rsquo;s voice shook as he took the paper from his
pocket and held it out to her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you seen this?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;Every one in
London knows you are here. It is madness to stay.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course I have seen it,&rdquo; she answered coolly.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></span>
&ldquo;And of course I shall not stay. I do but finish my
packing. In ten minutes I shall ring to have my
luggage taken downstairs. There is a train in half
an hour.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You will never escape now,&rdquo; he said gloomily.
&ldquo;Do you know, too, that they have found the body of
Mrs. Vanderstein?&rdquo;</p>

<p>This time she was startled.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you say?&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;What <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">b√™tise</i>
is this?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is true,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;They found it last night.
I was there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You were there? Last night?&rdquo; she repeated.
&ldquo;And you were not arrested, not suspected? Why,
then, our star is indeed guarding us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, I wasn&rsquo;t arrested,&rdquo; he said, watching her,
&ldquo;and Joolie hasn&rsquo;t been arrested yet, either.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She started, and for a moment her eyes shone with
the hatred and spite she cherished for her daughter.
Then they fell before his. &ldquo;Julie,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;why
should Julie be arrested?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you know?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;How is she to
account for the pearls, and for the dresses and opera
cloaks?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, the dresses. Hasn&rsquo;t she burnt them? I told
her to. If she has not she must do so at once.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And the pearls&mdash;was she to burn them too?&rdquo; said
Bert quietly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They looked so well round her neck, the dear
child. I left them as my wedding gift to you both.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You left them because you knew you couldn&rsquo;t
get rid of them. My God! I believe you meant to keep
the whole lot for yourself. But the pearls were too
dangerous, so you gave them to Joolie! You must
have meant suspicion to fall upon her!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My dear Bert, you are absurd. Come and help<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[334]</a></span>
me to fasten this portmanteau. I shall register the
luggage to Paris, and leave the train myself at Amiens.
From there I can go off in another direction, and you
will never hear of me again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nor of the jewels either, no doubt.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t be afraid, you shall have the money
for the jewels!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Madame Querterot began to go on with her packing,
which for the moment she had abandoned. As she
bent over the trunk, filling up corners with crumpled
newspapers, she hummed a merry little tune, and the
implied disregard of his reproaches exasperated Bert
beyond endurance. He stood quite still, making a
violent effort at self-control, and looking about him
in an unconscious attempt to regain his balance by a
concentration of his attention upon some everyday
object.</p>

<p>The fresh breeze off the water was fluttering the white
muslin blinds by the open window and, as Bert passed
his tongue over his parched lips, he tasted the salt
taste of the sea. The tide was up, and the room full
of the noise of the breaking waves, so that the rattle
of a cart passing on the road beneath was merged and
lost in the continuous volume of sound.</p>

<p>On the table were several outspread pieces of blue
paper, and he read the typed messages from where he
stood. They were the telegrams which Sir Gregory,
Gimblet, and Sidney had dispatched that morning to
Mrs. Vanderstein.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you answered those?&rdquo; he said, pointing to
them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I answered Mr. Sidney&rsquo;s, and I sent one to the
servants in Grosvenor Street,&rdquo; Madame Querterot
broke off her tune to reply.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know who Aberhyn Jones is,&rdquo; she
added, &ldquo;nor where he lives, so I can&rsquo;t answer him;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[335]</a></span>
and I haven&rsquo;t quite decided what to say to the
detective.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She went on packing, and resumed her humming.
Bert did not speak for a minute, then he said very
quietly:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I took the girl to Regent&rsquo;s Park, to the very edge
of the water; and then a policeman came up and prevented
me doing as we arranged.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What!&rdquo; Madame Querterot almost screamed.</p>

<p>She stood erect and gazed at Bert in incredulous
dismay.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hit her and ran,&rdquo; he went on. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t suppose
I did her much damage or I should have seen it mentioned
in the papers, and there has been nothing about
it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If she is alive I don&rsquo;t understand how it is they
still believe Mrs. Vanderstein is here. But never
mind that now. The point is, the girl, if she lives, will
put them on my track. I shall not be able to escape
now so easily. Perhaps the best thing to do is to go
back and face it out. Better get my story in before
they have time to puzzle out the truth.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She spoke musingly, more to herself than to her
companion.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your story!&rdquo; Bert repeated, speaking only a
little above a whisper. His voice would not come out
somehow; he felt as if he were choking. &ldquo;You mean
you will say that I did it! Why not say that you have
been hiding from me in fear of your own life, all these
days? That would round it off well!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not a bad suggestion, Bert,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I must
look after myself, you know. It would be a pity,
wouldn&rsquo;t it, for people to say that Julie&rsquo;s mother was
hanged?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She spoke with a sneer. She had not forgotten that
Bert had used those words to her, nor forgiven him. She<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[336]</a></span>
was not afraid to let him see that his guess at her
intentions was a good one; she felt for him a contempt
too complete and profound to dread anything he might
say or do.</p>

<p>It is a common failing among clever rascals to despise
their dupes, but they often learn to their cost that
danger may come from the most unlikely quarter.</p>

<p>The derisive note in her voice was the last straw on
Bert&rsquo;s frayed nerves. His rage took hold of him so that
he no longer knew what he was about; he became a
tool in other hands than Madame Querterot&rsquo;s.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh you fiend, you fiend!&rdquo; he cried, and his voice
was high and cracked, &ldquo;hanging would be too good for
a devil like you! You needn&rsquo;t be afraid, people never
shall say that of Joolie&rsquo;s mother. You would have let
her be hanged, you devil! Her and me, both of us.
Oh&mdash;oh&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>The air was full of the murmur of the sea. It
mingled with a maddening noise that buzzed in his
ears and made thought impossible. A mist gathered
before his eyes&mdash;a dreadful red mist in which everything
swam and danced.</p>

<p>He bounded upon the woman, holding his hands outstretched
before his face as though to fend off something
unspeakably hideous and terrifying. Then they
closed upon her throat and, with a sob, he shook her
to and fro as a dog shakes a rat that has bitten it badly.</p>

<p>At last his rage spent itself. As it passed he became
conscious of what he was doing, and with an exclamation
of disgust loosened his grip.</p>

<p>She fell backwards, with a crash, across the open lid
of the box she had been packing. The hinges snapped
under the impact and the lid broke off and dropped
to the floor with her. There she lay, head downwards,
in an untidy heap, one arm twisted at a curious angle
under her body.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[337]</a></span></p>

<p>Bert never doubted that she was dead, and he felt
a glow of satisfaction stealing over him at the knowledge.
There were great livid marks on her neck where
his convulsive fingers had clutched at it, and he stooped
over her and looked at them with a gratified smile.
They were already turning black.</p>

<p>A slight noise in the next room brought him to his
senses.</p>

<p>He crept on tiptoe to the door and listened intently
with his ear to it. The sounds in the next room continued,
some one seemed to be opening and shutting
drawers; but there was no movement in the passage,
and after a moment he opened the door cautiously and
went out.</p>

<p>No one was in sight, and as an afterthought he went
back, and removing the key locked the door on
the outside, as silently as he had opened it. Then
putting the key in his pocket he ran down the stairs.
The page who had shown him up was idling in the hall,
but no one else was about, though he caught a glimpse
of a seated figure in the bureau as he passed. Forcing
himself to pause as he passed the page, he said to him:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Vanderstein has asked me to tell you that she
has a headache, and does not wish to be disturbed
again to-day. Do you understand?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir. I will give the message at the bureau.
They will tell the waiter and chambermaid.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The page spoke English perfectly, and Bert felt
assured that he would do his errand. To make sure,
he repeated his injunction and gave the boy a shilling
to impress it on his memory. Then he walked down
the steps with every outward appearance of calm.</p>

<p>His impulse was to go back towards the harbour,
but as a precaution he started off in the opposite
direction and only approached the docks after several
turnings separated him from the sea-front. There<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[338]</a></span>
was no boat back to England, however, till past
seven, and he hung about the port for three whole hours
that seemed like three centuries. In a quiet corner
behind some empty trucks he got rid of his black
beard, and applying a match to it saw it frizzle up and
disappear in two or three seconds. He ground the
ashes into the earth with his heel, and with a recklessness
which surprised himself walked back past the
doorway of the H√¥tel de Douvres, to see if he would
be known. The page was still lolling in the doorway,
and, to Bert&rsquo;s satisfaction, stared at him as he passed
with a vacant eye. He felt certain he had not been
recognised, and went back to the harbour with a
lighter heart.</p>

<p>There he watched the steamer from Folkestone
arrive and disembark her passengers, among whom&mdash;though
he did not know it&mdash;was the man sent by the
London police to interview Mrs. Vanderstein; and a
few minutes later it was time to go on board the boat,
which took him back to England.</p>

<p>The next morning found him back in his place at
the house agents&rsquo; office, and as the day passed without
event he began to feel a sense of security to which he
had lately been a stranger. After all, he had passed
hours in the company of London&rsquo;s greatest detective
without arousing any suspicion; and every hour, he
believed, added to his safety.</p>

<p>He was comparatively cheerful when he went down
to Pimlico that evening to see Julie.</p>

<p>But he found her in a harder mood than usual; and
when, with exceeding want of discretion, he chose that
most unpropitious moment to urge his suit, she told
him very plainly that she would never consent to be
his wife.</p>

<p>She had no intention of marrying, she said; she was
going to enter the convent as she had always wished.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[339]</a></span>
But, she added, with unnecessary cruelty&mdash;for she was
still angry with him for his behaviour a day or two
before&mdash;in no case would she have married him. She
did not reciprocate his feelings, and she considered
that he and she were quite unsuited to each other;
he had much better never think of her again.</p>

<p>Thus it happened that he went away in the blackest
depths of misery and despair, so that when the police
rapped at his door an hour later they found a man
broken and unstrung to such a point as to hail their
coming with something like relief.</p>

<p>Such was the gist of Albert Tremmels&rsquo; story; and, as
it never varied in the smallest detail in the course of
its many repetitions, it may be imagined that it was
true in substance.</p>

<p>Whether this would have been the opinion expressed
by a jury cannot now be known, for Bert died in prison
while awaiting his trial. His constitution, always
frail, had not been able to withstand the bodily fatigues,
and more especially those torments of the mind which
he had endured during that week of stress, and a latent
tendency to disease was not slow to take advantage
of his weakened condition. Its rapid development
was perhaps due, in part, to the fact that he made little
effort to get well, and seemed to have no wish to live.
What, indeed, as he said, had he to live for?</p>

<p>He showed no repentance for his attack on Miss
Turner, beyond saying that it would have been unnecessary
if he had had the sense to kill Madame Querterot
first, but he maintained with his last breath that the
idea was not his, any more than the thought of murdering
Mrs. Vanderstein, which he persisted in affirming
had never crossed his mind. He gloried in the death
of his confederate, however, nor could all the efforts
of the prison chaplain move him to a better frame of
mind with regard to his deed. On the contrary, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[340]</a></span>
did not cease to gloat over the remembrance of it.
Not even when he heard that Julie piously refused
him her forgiveness, in spite of her mother&rsquo;s designs
upon herself, would Bert admit that he regretted that
which he had done. It is a cynical freak of circumstance
that his love for the girl, which was pure and unselfish
and the only creditable part of his whole nature, should
from first to last have been the inspiring source from
which his crimes proceeded.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXVIII" id="CHAPTER_XXVIII">CHAPTER XXVIII</a></h2>


<p class="cap"><span class="upper">It</span> was a few days before Joe Sidney was allowed
to see Barbara. The news of her friend&rsquo;s death
had been broken to her by the doctor, and though
her grief was profound she bore the shock better than
they had feared likely, and continued to make good
progress towards recovery.</p>

<p>It was on the day following that on which she learnt
the truth, or rather a bowdlerised version of it, that
Sidney refused to be longer denied, and practically
forced his way into the private room at the hospital
to which she had been moved.</p>

<p>At sight of her sad, tear-stained face, framed in
bandages, and wearing such a different aspect from
when he had last looked on it, the little speech he had
prepared to greet her with died on his lips, and he could
only take her hand in silence and gaze at her without
a word till the door had shut behind the nurse, who,
dearly as she would have liked to remain, was luckily
prevented from doing so by an urgent summons to
attend on the house surgeon elsewhere.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, my dear, I thought you were dead,&rdquo; he
stammered.</p>

<p>She was very weak still, and while the tenderness
in his voice, still more than the words themselves,
brought a feeble little smile of the purest content to
play a moment round the corners of her mouth, they
also caused the blood to rush to her face in a hot,
embarrassing wave, so that she turned her head away,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[342]</a></span>
and lay facing the wall with no conscious wish except
to hide from him.</p>

<p>Then the flush died away, leaving her very white
and still and silent, with eyes tightly shut. She knew
that if she opened them or tried to speak she would
not be able to help crying.</p>

<p>Sidney did not understand her stillness. A dreadful
fear came upon him that she had fainted, and he looked
round for the bell. It was just out of reach; but,
when he tried to withdraw the hand which still held
hers, her clasp gently tightened on it, and would not
let him go.</p>

<p>With a muffled exclamation he fell on his knees beside
the pillow.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Barbara, Barbara,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;will you always
go hand in hand with me now?&rdquo;</p>

<p>And with face still averted she murmured: &ldquo;Always,
always!&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was half an hour later that he asked her about
the unsigned telegram she had sent him. What had
she meant by saying good luck was coming his way?</p>

<p>She reluctantly confessed her determination to provide
him with the money he needed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course I always knew you were clever and dear
enough to manage even that,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s why
I didn&rsquo;t bother unnecessarily over the mess I&rsquo;d got
into.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; cried Barbara, &ldquo;how dare you say that!
Why, you were desperate; I was terrified by the things
you hinted at.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was disgraceful of me to talk in that way,&rdquo; he
admitted, ashamed. &ldquo;But you haven&rsquo;t told me how
you intended to provide me with money. As if I&rsquo;d
have taken it from you! I didn&rsquo;t know you were a
millionaire.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You know Mr. Vanderstein left me ¬£30,000, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[343]</a></span>
I was to have if poor Mrs. Vanderstein died? I shall
get it now, I suppose,&rdquo; said Barbara, her eyes filling
with tears.</p>

<p>Joe stroked her hand in silent sympathy, and with
a quaver in her voice she went on.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I meant to borrow ¬£10,000 on the strength of
my prospects, and place it anonymously to your credit
at Cox&rsquo;s. So you see you would have had to take it!&rdquo;
she concluded triumphantly. &ldquo;You wouldn&rsquo;t have
known who it was from.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should have known perfectly well,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;Who else could good luck come to me from if not
from you? I knew you sent the telegram, you see.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You couldn&rsquo;t have proved it, and you&rsquo;d have had
to take the money, because there would have been no
one to send it back to.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was like you to think of it,&rdquo; Joe said, &ldquo;but
I don&rsquo;t believe you could have raised the money anyhow.
Aunt Ruth&rsquo;s life was nearly as good as yours
then, and you hadn&rsquo;t really any security to offer, you
silly darling.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Barbara&rsquo;s face fell. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t think of that, but
surely I could have got ¬£10,000 when I would have
offered ¬£30,000 in exchange,&rdquo; she said sadly. &ldquo;But
it doesn&rsquo;t matter now, does it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He hastened to reassure and comfort her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And you will never bet again?&rdquo; she asked
presently.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have sworn that I never will,&rdquo; Joe answered.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had a lesson more severe than even I needed, I
think.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If ever you want to have a teeny tiny bet,&rdquo; she
smiled, &ldquo;I can do it for you, perhaps, if you&rsquo;re good.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; he said seriously, &ldquo;you must give it up
too. I shall want you to help me to stick to my resolutions.
Promise!&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[344]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; she said, seeing how grave he looked;
&ldquo;I promise faithfully never to gamble again in any
way, as long as I live.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now we are safe!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;Indeed, I have used
up all the luck one man can scrape together in a lifetime
in winning you, and I shall think of that, if I am
ever again tempted to stake anything on the chance
of further kindness at the hands of Fortune.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be foolish,&rdquo; Barbara urged; &ldquo;there is heaps
and heaps more luck in store for you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And so, in their serene confidence of the happy future
which awaits them, we will leave these two young
people, who, if any more dangers lie unsuspected in
the path down which they are to travel through the
years, will brave them no longer in solitary isolation,
but strengthened and reinforced by an enduring love.</p>
